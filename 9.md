### Chapter `IX`: Gremlin Empire

Across the analysis we were noting different elements of gremlin technology, society, and what came of them. But in order to attain the fullest and deepest understanding of gremlin civilization, we need to analyze its history from several different perspectives in the similar manner as our previous discussions regarding tortomega, devilite, Isorian, and Owlite civilizations. Here, with all of the knowledge of those histories, which were eventually incorporated into Cradle, we can begin to arrange them within the context of Cradle and Clockworks.

#### Great Colony and Iron Law

We begin with the Great Colony. Most of the general and relatively direct trivia regarding gremlin civilization's past is found in Haven from Strangers as well as from a few other places. But, due to nature of the sources, a supposed gremlin king Tinkinzar is mentioned, whose validity of existence yet has to be discussed. Currently, we are concerned with the position of the Great Colony within gremlin society.

- `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins.` (npc: [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- `All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the kind is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king.` (npc: [Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)).

  We have to keep in mind, that a potential element of unreliability might be present here through the wording of `Tinkinzar is said to be ...` and `It is our understanding ...`
- `... Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins. Not part of plan!` (npc: [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- `We believe they are developing some kind of weeping they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself. Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace.` (npc: [An Explosive Plot - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Explosive_Plot))
- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` (npc: [Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired))
- `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely.` (desc: [Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)).

  Here it is said that Tinkinzar is still present and directly oversees the plan, mentioned by Pakrat.
- `A very convincing costume that makes the wearer look like a gremlin. It's so convincing, you just might receive an invitation to the Colony!` (desc: [Gremlin Disguise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Disguise)). The colony wih the capital C refers here to the Great Colony, as no other settle of an implied scope was established.
- `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared.` (desc: [Spark And Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex: Danger Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)). Here we are interested only in the nature of the ron Law.

Now we can outline basic relations:

- A state of Great Colony and relative order is maintained through the concept of Iron Law.
- As gremlins of Great Colony serve King Tinkinzar, they also obey the Iron law, which fits the idea of Great Colony gremlin considering the rest as traitors.
- The Iron Law, based of Herex's information and his overview of this concept, seem to suggest that, apart from Crimson Order enforcing and upholding it, the Law itself is a tangible concept within the greater scheme of relations, which involve Herex's plans. Based on this, we can conclude that the very idea of the Law being uprooted would also be considered a betrayal. The validity of the Law itself bing true is not yet questioned here, but rather it allows us to understand basic idea behind governance of gremlins.
- An idea of a master plan exists, which is allegedly devised by Tinkinzar and enforced by Crimson Order within the grand context of Cradle. Under this directive existence of Emberlight is harmful to Plan's execution.

To summarize those points, due to unknown nature of this plan, the validity of the claim, that Emberlight's existence could harm it, creates at least 2 interpretations, distinguished mainly by the degree of false information being distributed across non-Crimson Order gremlins, which, considering general dystopian inspiration, does seem as a valid assumption:

- Iron Law is devised with the entire understanding of Cradle and Clockworks, as well as nature of the Core, if Herex is to be believed.
- Iron Law is a form of suppression of any state outside of Great Colony and distinct clans. Herex's presence in this interpretation would seem as if Crimson Order itself now considers the Law truthful or is unaware of its false nature.

We will keep his idea in mind until our analysis of [Crimson Order](#crimson-order). There is one more conflicting interpretation of the term Great Colony, which we will hold off until the analysis of the [mending rune](#mending-rune-and-gremlin-emblem). Until then we will consider Great Colony as a literal location.

As we have not heard of gremlins in the context of other civilizations, we can make a plausible explanation for it being the fact that those periods of time were prior to incorporation into Cradle. But it unknown weather Cradle is as old as those civilizations - are Clockworks as old as, for example, heavenly kingdom or tortomega even in two of the latter were not yet taken into Clockworks? If gremlins are to be considered one of the more technologically advanced civilizations to date on par with urban occult setting of devilites, [represented as unknown Undercorp](), [heavenly kingdom of valkyries]() with [Owlite Academy](), and [Almire](), - gremlins, through Clockworks, had managed to connect all of the above despite lingering existential threats within each epoch.

Based on the quote `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` (npc: [Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)) we have to assume that Tinkinzar came before Clockworks and subsequently Cradle. Yet, it is due Pakrat's recount of events it is known that a many years had passed since one saw the king: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle.` (npc: [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)). Based in this information already we believe that Tinkinzar is far older than it might be expected of gremlin specie. We have made such conclusion based on the phrasing Pakrat uses, as if Tinkinzar was still present in the past but after Pakrat was born. We will return to a different interpretation of the king within the analysis of Crimson Order, but currently, we have to consider this time discrepancy as an argument if favour of our explanation of events of ghost in The Machine and unresolved existence of laser technology.

So, this idea of a assumed to be immortal king also ties in with a concept, first established during the [analysis of Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine), - that Ironclaw Munitions Factory is the assembly line for not only Roarmulus Twins but other technology, specifically shock-themed lasers, the same ones present on Big Iron battlepod. [This battlepod secures the bridge of Isorian Vessel in the Iron Hulk](). This large time span is based of the fact the bodies of space jockeys to that point had turned to dust, haunting the space vessel, while gremlins had to contain in in the Dry Docks with their own machinery, primarily mecha knights.

Then there is the name of Great Colony. Great Colony can be characterized as gremlin capital in a general sense, based of the known clans and depths, but disregarding a possibility of a greater scope entity, as none was currently presented. Considering the time spans we are working with, some evidence of gremlins' presence on Cradle had to be established from the very beginning of Clockworks construction, so the Great Colony must be one of the oldest developments.

We propose, that the name itself here suggests that the Great Colony is a literal colony, a colonial domain on a distant planet - that of Cradle, - meaning, that there exists a gremlin interstellar empire with a remote metropole, to which Great Colony had to belong, rather than a civilization relegated to single planet of Cradle.

As Great Colony is one of more significant locations of gremlin civilization on Cradle, and considering how ancient are Clockworks themselves, even taking in account that gremlins were implied to be assisted in it's construction - `... Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsable. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force ...` (npc: [Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)), and `if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why? It's all a bit too convenient. But do gremlins really have this kind of power? I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering.` (npc: [Eye of the Needle - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)), - Clockworks should have been present at least by the time Iron Hulk was haunted.

Of course, there exists a possibility of Clockworks existing for thousands of years, which does seem more plausible, as then Strangers of Haven would not have any modern recounts of Clockworks beginnings: `"How old are the Clockworks?" - It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures. This world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine ...` (npc: [Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)). That is, if their responses are taken at face value, and with an assumption that Clockworks had not appeared in a few hundred years, even with an assistance of currently unknowns third party, as Plinkplop's and Kora's dialogues suggest.

We could analyze the location of Great Colony in the same manner, as we had attempted to understand what purpose dry docks serve and the architecture of Owlite Academy. But here, it is not the location itself is important, but rather an understanding of what had happened before current hierarchy of clans was established.

Considering the scale of Clockworks, as they comprise most likely most of all known volume of the planet, we assume, that some foundation for their construction, the raw materials, had to be gathered somewhere - be it a different planets or the one from which initially the construction began. In the first case, we can appeal to the idea of many worlds being literally gathered, put together as Cradle, which may place Great Colony as the very first location of gremlin settlement, designed for, potentially environment of vacuum. The second case can lead to Great Colony being also the first settlement, but within an environment of a regular planet, that was harvested to build Clockworks.

While those explanations have speculative foundation based on the lack of any information, they remove a dependency on an undisclosed planet, and at least, weave it into the general narrative, as the prior had to be incorporated into Cradle either way at some point in time under current chronology. This planet had to contain most of the entities from the timeline: dragons, Owlites, Kats, Almire. These include later discoveries of the Nameless Realm and Underworld. This proposal, then, would not conflict with epochs of kingdom of Almire. Despite a possibility of decoupling Almire's narrative and history from the rest, mainly from the origins of legion of Ur and the relation to heavenly kingdom of valkyries, mentioned forgotten time, it would not bring drastic changes to the timeline, as currently all of the Underworld-adjacent laws are not restricted by presence of the Core, apart from spirits returning to material realm.

#### Gremlin Physiology

As for gremlins, while the location of Great Colony remains unknown, we still can attempt to guess, what it was before any large-scale construction of Clockworks had begun:

- Considering gremlins of all known clans, - Tenderfoot, Ironclaw, Darkfang, and Grinchlins, - wear goggles, including those located in Emberlights, we can suggests that underground conditions had taken effect on gremlin physiology. Gremlins of Haven, such as Pakrat, Punch, and Vise, still wear similar uniform and have obscured muzzle with goggles or masks reminiscent of Strangers' design.

  There is a case of Crimson Order member, Seerus, as he lacks any explicitly advanced equipment, preferring a mask over goggles, through which his spiral eyes are seen. This, with ths general motif of Seerus being described as: `Taking on ol' Seerus aye? Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one. He and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering. ...` (npc: [Operation Crimson Hammer - Lobby - Vise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise)), seems as a design decision, rather than his status as a member of the Order.
- Presence of Sun and Moon plates within Clockworks' artificial sky of skydomes. The moon is identical to one on Cradle's orbit, as both have a characteristic spiral on the near side.

  The fact those are located within Clockwork skydomes does suggest that those locations are built to house biospheres, when compared to regular Clockwork tunnels. But, apart from budget restrictions of the game, why would both celestial bodies had to be presented as ones of Cradle's star system, with all of the moving machinery accompanying it?

  It is also within those skydomes gremlin facilities - the compounds, - are present on par with other stratums in archaeological sense, such as tortomega ruins across Aurora Isles in their different forms.

Based on those elements we can suggest that gremlins, as a specie, had to be either nocturnal or inhabiting planetary surface under natural conditions. A question can be posed - gremlins could be originally cave-dwelling species, but then, presence of fur makes it an uncommon characteristic of such specie. It is also presence of a day-night cycle within the skydomes which would point to more natural conditions in the past, be it Cradle, a different planet, or gremlin homeworld.

#### Gremlin Military-Idustrial Complex

As compounds were considered as a form of lesser gremlin facilities within skydomes, we have to address the more general notions, inspirations, and motifs of modern-day gremlin civilization.

Throughout rank missions and the Arcade gates several gremlin facilities are encountered, those are compounds, located within biospheres of skydomes, and rank-mission exclusive underground complexes. The latter, specifically Camp Crimson and complex 357, as well as the Grand Arsenal, share same security measures, such as barbed wire, anti-tank concrete blocks, likely serving same purpose as dragon's teeth, and anti-tank hedgehogs.

Apart from those structure there are production centers and research facilities, from which Ironlaw Munitions Factory and compound 42 stand out as most prominent, but not the only ones.

Based on this information we have at least 2 types of numbered facilities - compounds and complexes. Their ownership strategy remains vague, which will be analyzed further.

##### Mecha Knight Factories

One of more characteristic elements of gremlins was their skillful creation of constructs, such as battlepods, mecha knights, and lastly gun puppies. We will return to gun puppies motif later, as they were already present as creations of tortomega but now we will focus on mecha knights.

One of such factories is found during [Toy Soldiers mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers): `Recon Knights ... have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. Mecha Knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight. ...`. This factory, as suggested by the layout of [Factory Floor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers#Gate_Map), is located within Clockwork service tunnels outside of skydomes. Deeper into the factory the [Production Center](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers/Production_Center) itself is located.

The production center is controlled by the battlepod surrounded by a hexagonal shield. Since this pattern of a shield is present only on battlepods, we can conclude that it is a gremlin invention.

##### Heavy Weapons Facility: Sparkcaster and Sputterspark

The Heavy Weapons Facility is found during [Shocking Sentinel Sentries mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries) and is described as: `... a secret weapons facility that according to the intel ..., could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order. It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs ... While it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash.` (desc: [Shocking Sentinel Sentries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries)). The fact of it's belonging is later confirmed by the dialogue between [Sputterspark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sputterspark) - an engineer, and warmaster Seerus of Crimson Order, within the final floor of the facility: `The Sparkcaster Deluxe is almost stable, I promise. I need a little more time, Warmaster. ... It looks like time has run out, Sputterspark. You'd better hope your little toy works.` (npc: [Sputterspask and Seerus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries/Heavy_Weapons_Facility)).

The facility itself houses a stationary device Sparkcaster, whose purpose, judging by the second encounter during [Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape) in the prison [yard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard), is to hinder enemy movement on the frontlines by remote generation of artificial lightning from the rear.

Considering that the facility is marked as secret, it is plausible that Sparkcaster is of the same purpose as compound 42 of Herex of Crimson Order: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin.` (npc: [Compound 42 - Containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), - that of Crimson Order member's secret research facility.

The second iteration of the device is labelled as Sparkcaster 9000 Deluxe. Considering that it is stated as a triumph in gremlin engineering, we may read it in 2 ways: a comical hyperbole for the narrative as an actual analysis of the device with all of known laws of physic in mind.

As we are analyzing and connecting everything, we will go with the latter option. Specifically, the sole act of the device casting relatively controlled lightning is deeply related to the principles underlying Clockwork Power Complexes. We will return to Sparkcaster in that section later.

##### Test Labs

One of testing laboratories was found to contain schematics for Roarmulus Twins, or at that point in time, known only as Project R during the events of [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack): `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. ...` (desc: [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

##### Weapon Caches, Factories, and Munition Storages

Mission [Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash) establishes existence of weapon caches across Clockworks: `... Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. One of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems. ...` (desc: [Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash)). That weapon cache contains instances of battlepods.

A decommissioned type of similar munitions storages and factories is explored through [Assualt on Machine Shop 13](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Assault_on_Machine_Shop_13) mission - `... decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines ...`, proving presence of factories across varying terrain.

##### Crimson Order Hideouts

Established during the event of [Spark and Roar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar): `An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout.` A [Hidden Hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout) presents itself as one belonging to Herex, but the ownership and it's state are not important currently. It is its size and location. Before actual arena knights had to traverse a march and Iron Tundra, while the latter is a deconstruction zone, we have to consider general theme of being a small hideout of a member of Crimson Order deep in the frozen location. The arena depth might suggest it being a security measure for the hideout itself, which, while hidden in cold of what can be considered a taiga, might suggest it being a personal quarters, for example, in case of severe emergency. And judging by the contents of the hideout, emergency it was. indeed.

The [size](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Hidden_Hideout.jpg) of the hideout is also of interest to us, as it isn't large, containing only a few points of interest:

- A yard with a Crimson Order insignia.
- Workstation with vials and information module
- Entrance and exit elevators connected to the system of Clockwork gates.

Another point of interest are the cisterns and the main structural body behind the exit elevator. The location's design itself resembles gremlin town of [Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight), that is the hull is habitable and likely contains proper living quarters, which would suffice a few gremlins for a limited time as it is first and foremost a hideout. Potentially a bunker, even, considering the metal beam extending upwards, suggesting a reinforced structure.

##### Compound 42 and Slime Generators

As for the rest of military research facilities, there is compound 42, which specializes in production of bioweapons. It is described as: `... a gremlin bioweapons facility deep within the Clockworks. It is believed that this facility belongs to a member of the Crimson Order known only as Herex. The Recon Rangers have been tasked with infiltrating the facility and uncovering the nature of Herex's bioweapons before they are put to use.`

When it is infiltrated, it is discovered that Herex had already ordered to burn it, removing all of evidence of it's existence: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin. All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground.` (npc: [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)). The poison with intelligence of standard bio-toxin question are the [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxoil).

The facility contains large storage tubes of green gel. Based on the quote `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` (npc: [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), we can make a working assumption that this gel content is the bio-toxin. But, this puts in question a natural origin of [toxoilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxoil) and [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel). Regular [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel) and then oilers are both also found across locations, which does not seem to be connected to the compound.

At the last arena of the [containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment) 6 large tubes of orange gel are found in the end of the structure, several of which are seen to be leaking. We suggest those are the basis for oilers in order to produce what became toxoils. There are also 3 large leaking tubes of green gel on the west side of the structure, toxic gel, comprising toxigels.

During the event of [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine) mission lichens were also involved: `Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. Squads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23. It is time ... to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. Any data that you could collect as their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ.` (desc: [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine)). The generators are presented in the [Processing Plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) as 2 battlepods creating not toxic, but [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver) lichens.

Considering past knowledge of Herex specializing in bioweapons, involving accidental creation or mutation of lichens in compound 42, an assumption could be made that this facility does also relate to Herex. Yet, this inconsistency of the [processing plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) itself will be kept in mind for the analysis of quicksilver lichens.

##### Camp Crimson and Prisons

[Camp Crimson](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson) is one of 2 known facilities of a distinct design. While Camp Crimson is not seen from the outside, the other location, complex 357 is.

The camp, within a proximity of an entrance, contains what seems to be rail tracks for the transportation vessels, resembling armored trains. Those vessels are armed with an artillery canons on the their roofs and contain barred cells within the hull. The same cells are observed all across the camp, with a few placed within the metal scaffolding-like structures above and below the depth of a camp. The rails themselves are also found leading up and into the fortified perimeter of [Grand Arsenal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Arsenal), and seen multiple times within the arsenal.

Entirety of the camp's site is structured as a highly secured location, with search lights, armored watchtowers, and barbed wire. Apart from those, a peculiar element of metal pillars is seen across the camp, explicitly noticeable near the exit elevator, with rows of pillars extending upwards, with widespread usage of Crimson Order insignia. All of those designs are present both across Camp Crsimson and later discussed complex 357.

It is unknown weather camps as such had operated solely as prisons, or were of worse purpose. Yet, as knights had arrived relatively recently, we can suggest that those structures were built within the context of clan and Crimson Order members' inner conflicts.

As for the Spiral Order, there are events of [Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape): `Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned. It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. Further data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built. Spiral HQ however has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out.` The fact that this solution is suggested to be a temporary one, we can guess that the earlier question of Camp Crimson purpose may potentially be of the latter.

##### Complex 357

Encountered at the end of [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos), [Complex 357](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos/Complex_357) is a highly guarded facility, and the only one across rank missions, whose surface entrance is seen. While located within a compound area of skydome, the main facility is very distinct by it's design, most reminiscent of an imperial style:

- Its inner yard has a wide inclined ascent to the entrance.
- To the sides of the main road, patches of grass with trees, and, more importantly, gun puppy statues, as ones found across the grounds of tortomega civilization are found.
- Crimson order tapestry is seen on the armor plated of the front facility.
- Largest to date amount of battlepods at the entrance, albeit already destroyed.
- As in Camp Crismon, there are hanging tapestries of Crimson Order insignia.

The complex itself is described in the [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos) mission as follows: `Spiral HQ has been monitoring several known Crimson Order bases in hopes of intercepting one of their elusive high-ranking members. Recon knights assigned to watch one of those bases report that it has suddenly gone silent and have requested backup before investigating it further.` The gate icon of the inner facility, the underground complex itself, is the same image of a rocket utilized to mark depths related to the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. The Recon soldier and the entrance to the complex reports: `We've been monitoring the base for weeks then it went silent. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms.`

The contents of the facility were crucial enough for Herex to infiltrate it, as suggested by general state it is found as well as the information module belonging to Herex: `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other.` (npc: [Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)). There are valuable schematics which were the goal of infiltration. At that point we do not know the purpose of those. The facility itself contains only poison-themed constructs, alluding to Herex's themes. But it is a matter of discussion, weather the facility belongs to Herex. This is due to the fact Knight hadn't discovered any activity or large-scale invasion, which makes it seem to us in 2 ways:

- The facility had already contained poison-themes constructs.
- A different entrance was used to transport the army.

Judging by the general theming as well as the fact Herex is seen to do his operations by his own (desc: `Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground.` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) and several gremlin Stalkers, we lean to a narrative wherein him and a few Stalkers had infiltrated the complex unnoticed. The matter of facility's ownership here then seemingly concludes on being of Herex's. And it is in the main entrance after the bridge 2 poison-themed gun puppies are seen at respawn pads behind the barricade.

But a counterpoint can be introduced here, it is during the events of Shadowplay Herex had arrived with an army of poison-themed constructs and gremlins to the location of the Mysterious Console behind the Throne Room of Firestorm Citadel.

We can analyze the facility itself, as compared to Camp Crimson, it is seen in already damaged state:

- The central entrance of 9 tiles width to the first gatehouse surrounded by 2 armored watchtowers and accompanied by metal pillars, is severely damaged. The part of the bridge is torn off, and the part leading up the the gates has signs of bombardment or other force to cause elongated cracks on the bridge.

  This level of damage could not be likely done by sole action sof Herex and Stalkers.
- The facility is filled with mineral rocks, which seem to hinder the movement deeper into the complex.

Apart the above elements several rooms seem to contain the desired schematics:

- East of the first gates there is a room with a gold key, secured by 5 gate-button pairs. It has a single rocket launcher - [gun blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Gun_Block.png), 1 dead gremlin and multiple torn pages on the floor, 2 clips, and multiple monitors
- West of the first gates a room before a puzzle contains 2 cisterns, purple and green tubes of gel, monitors, a few smaller vials, 1 clip and a gremlin with also many torn pages on the floor surrounding it. Notably, at the thin entrance to the room, west of it a pool of gel and valestone is seen pumped out of the smaller pipe. Norse of the most-west section with rocket launchers a single tube of green liquid is locate. A few grinded luminite minerals are found below it.
- The final room is located north of the complex, beyond the battlepod. There are also torn pages, several monitors, 2 clips, notable, several large books - as one opened and a few tomes, and a dead gremlin. Judging by that, it seems that the infiltration was sudden, and has happened while the facility had operated normally.

Due to those factor, as well as Herex's seeming disregard for personnel during the events of compound 42 annihilation, this complex seems to belong to Herex. The constructs present there then could the ones used by him in the Throne Room, as they had to be built at someone's production center, if taken in account facilities discussed in [Mecha knight Factories section](#mecha-knight-factories). The "inner fold" mentioned in the secret memo of Compound 42 seem to suggest it being those Stalkers (desc: `All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold.` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) as well a few gremlins fought in the [Throne Room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay) of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay).

##### Cradle Defenses

Cradle weapons are encountered directly during intro cinematic, as were used on Skylark as well as potentially mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans.` (npc: [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

Judging by the footage, the beams had originated from the exposed Clockwork segments from 3 sources. The beams themselves are most reminiscent of lasers utilized by the battlepods of Grand Arsenal and Big Iron, as well as incorporated into Roarmulus Twins. A key difference here is the fact those lasers are purple. It can be explained by an application of shadow damage, which seems as both most plausible and single explanation.

Usage of shadow damage is not novel for gremlins, as they did utilize it, although in lesser amounts, mostly attributed to the members of Crimson Order, such as Seerus and his devices bombs - [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution) alchemy tree: `The perfected version of the shadowy bomb that Warmaster Seerus engineered with the sole purpose of eliminating other gremlins that stood in his way. It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order.` (desc: [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution)). So the usage of it for the planetary defenses seems as likely explanation, considering that shadow damage is known to be dangerous both to gremlins and lichens.

##### The Collector

The Collector is described as follows: `There have been reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks. Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and the sprites it has taken captive.` (desc: [The Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector)).

Based on the analysis of Camp Crimson we came to conclusion, that the camp itself was established prior to arrival of Spiral Order, and, due to ability to capture Knights and Sprites by the Collector, we propose that its previous function was to capture gremlins.

Apart from this, it is likely that it had also served as an elite unit across constructs such as mecha knights by the fact of having similar design of wrenches in place of limbs and great offensive capabilities.

One of greater importance elements of its arsenal is the large charged explosion. This is the key element to a larger motif which will be then analyzed across gremlin technology. The explosion in both instances of the Collector - within the camp and at the [Overworks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/The_Overworks), - deals split shadow and normal damage, its only shadow damaging attack. Moreover, the explosion has an antique evil eye to appear, the same observed across Electron and Graviton bombs design. Considering this, a white painted evil eye of the same antique design with the Collector's eye meant to be an iris seems as an intentional design choice, which also points to its explosive shadow damage attack.

Apart from it, a different relation to curse arises here. Lord Vanaduke, when he has no mask, has red and orange arcs of lightning around him. Thos lightnings are the same as the collector. Moreover, Arkus also in his later stages of the fight has lightning arcs present in the same pattern, although of purple color, same as Darkfire Vanaduke unmasked. We suggest that this is a clear design pattern. If it would not be for the evil eye, this would not be a reason for an analysis of the latter that early. But, as the theme of curse in its different forms is consistent here, we propose that it serves as an argument for the collector being constructed utilizing far more advanced technology, involving Underworld and whatever is the power symbolized by the dread seal.

##### Electron Vortex

Electron vortex is an elemental counterpart of the Graviton bomb, but both have the same animation and presence of an antique evil eye of the same shape as the Collector. The case of the Collector - due to its explosion's design, we propose, is of the same nature as more likely electron bomb and less likely graviton bomb, yet, tapping into the powers of curse and Underworld.

But, due to descriptions of those bombs we believe they were invented in different period of time:

- `A small explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a vortex of crushing gravity.` (desc: [Graviton Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Charge))
- `A Graviton Bomb fortified with potentially dangerous amounts of shadow steel. Its blast should draw your foes toward it... if it doesn't rip the entire universe in two, that is.` (desc: [Graviton Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex))
- `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity.` (desc: [Electron Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge))
- `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock.` (desc: [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb))
- `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck".` (desc: [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)). As it is stated to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence,` and by the fact of being a 5-star equipment, it has 1 additional material to its recipe - [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser): `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps.` - which seems to us as direct confirmation of the elemental being used in the transmutation process.

We propose an explanation. That is gremlins have invented [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) based of the [Graviton Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) through introduction of their own tech, specifically related to electricity and shock, such as Storm Chasers, as it is present in the recipe. As it is an elemental counterpart to Graviton Bomb, the reason for devilish material - [Forbidden Fruit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit) specifically, had to be justified, which here, we suggest, is a common underlying motif. It can be argued that Forbidden Vruit is also used transmute [Twisted Spine Cone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Spine_Cone), but we have to remember that Snarbolax, whom this item is attributed, is related to curse and then Underworld.

##### Gremlin Incenerators

Incenerator gremlins found in the end of compound 42 have a unique design. Not only they are as large as Razwog, their masks seem to suggest a similar inspiration. Those masks differ from regular wielding masks by the fact of being less of a visor and more of an eye. Notably, the plate this red eye is located on, also is capable of moving across the height of helm's surface as it has a slot underneath, similar to collector's head design. Considering those scorchers are an elite units implied to be under a command of Herex of Crimson Order, we can make an educated guess that the collector's design in the context of gremlin elite units is more common than it seems.

##### Grand Arsenal

One of a few elements worth mentioning within the Grand Arsenal are the railways extending from the frontiers of of the complex. While no transportation carts were seen across the operation, we can suggest at least 2 uses for them:

- as there are several holding cells within the facility, it can be argued that those were transported across the rails, but, their number is abysmal compared to the construction of Camp Crismon.
- A more likely explanation is those railways are designed to deliver ammunition from the complex. Grand Arsenal is the only place apart from Razwog's facility above power complex, wherein [unused rockets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Unused_Rocket.png) with gremlin symbol are visibly used.

Then there are what seems to be conveyors for missiles found below the Grand Arsenal artillery - 2 lines of missiles extending from the chambers protected with red force fields. Those 2 lines then, passing through a wall of the facility end with vertical launching systems, as evident by both the metal beams and how those rockets react to being damaged - by launching upwards. Since it is essentially a fortified arsenal storage facility, we can gather that it is not the production lines, but only of delivery and transportation.

##### Crimson Throne and Aftermath

The other point of interest is located at the end of Grand Arsenal, in the innermost location only labeled as "Aftermath" during the operation. It is accessed from behind the wall of the main entrance of the Arsenal, wherein the arsenal itself is found, with Crismon Order tapestry hanging above. This part of facility is seeming the only one with visible walls extending above the ground level, resembling lobbies of danger missions.

The location of Aftermath is the main briefing room of the facility, as due to its unique execution with Crimson Order throne present at its center surrounded by hulls of inactive Roarmulus Twins. Apart from the throne, there are 3 distinct areas, sides of the throne 6 monitors are present, which seem to contain the most important for Spiral Order data. One of the soldiers accompanying Feron comments on the gremlin cryptography: `` (). We will revisit it later. The other area is located south of the throne, it is the one seen first, it also contains several non-interactive computers.

By the sides of the throne room, there are 2 lines of storage, containing inactive and damaged Roarmulus Twins and battlepods. Weather those are manufactured within the facility is unknown, but, as suggested by presence of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, it seems that the latter is responsible for the production, while Arsenal is mostly utilized for storage. The only ill-fit element in this interpretation are the 2 production lines found below the artillery, as the design it too distinct to be unintentional.

#### Ironclaw Munitions Factory

Ironclaw Munitions Factory presents a few novel concepts as well as reaffirms several previous ones. First we must note on the scope of the analysis of the factory - we consider Shadow Ironclaw Munitions factory, currently, at least, from the point of layout and its contents, - that both shock-themed and fire-themed factory is canon. With that in mind we will go through both of them starting from the regular variant.

The factory is described as follows:

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory is a gremlin-operated weapons factory that specializes in the production of high-calibur explosives. Intel has revealed that it is developing a secret weapon known as 'Project Roarmulus' designed with the sole purpose of destroying Haven!` (desc: [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).
- `Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R', the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven. Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself!` (desc: [Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)).
- `After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ know knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility. Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven. Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details.` (desc: [Target Acquired](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired))
- `... Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' ... Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! ... Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade. ... We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory.' The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. ... There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory..` (npc: [Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired))

Based on the earlier analysis we had concluded that th factory itself is at least hundred years old due to presence of laser technology, its research and development. The deteriorated state of the [abandoned assembly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Abandoned_Assembly) and due to its name we can draw parallels with the state complex 357 is found in as well as its gate icon.

Entrance to the factory, same as complex 357, is also particularly distinct. The entrance is a wide road - 11 tiles, with an entrance of 4 tiles. Around the entrance road there are 6 structure support beams or pillars with the foundation of Clockworks' design. Several roads leading up to the entrance apart from the elevator are blown off, with significant structural damage to the road itself.

Once inside the walls the factory separates into 2 wings, both of which contain several instances of Project R components, all of which were depicted on the [Roarmulus Blueprints](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Blueprints). Apart from it several deign choices are seem in the eastern wing which seem to suggest those being conveyor belts.

Within the Warfare Workshop another feature of the factory becomes more consistent, which was also present on previous depth - pools of [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver) slime. Those are reminiscent of previously discussed compound 42's likely artificially created [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxoil).

As for Workshop's layout, it has a central hall, separated from the machinery on the sides with walls, and during infiltration it is notable that western wing was not visited, although the path their remains intact. But it is the left wing which allows to understand approximate size of the facility, with the same design of 3 spaciously places support pillars as those found near the entrance hall of the facility, and eastern wall being a support or scaffolding structure. It is also in the western wing an internal components of the Roarmulus twin are seen. In the end of the facility's floor and to the west testing grounds for laser cannons are present.

In the final depth of the facility, which is also described as its deepest point (desc: `Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory ...` - [Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)) the same large structure beams are consistently placed in relatively large amount, as in previously discussed Herex's [hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout). We believe, those serve the same purpose - as they are present in the deepest points of both locations, they also mark it as, seemingly, most secure, as conveyed by the design choice of those beams being placed.

If the entire plot of Project R is taken in consideration with the context of the factory being at that level of maintenance, we can make a guess that the gremlin society is long past its prime.

Now, there are not many elemental gremlin weapons in a sense closer to Owlites, as they had directly utilized elemental powers, relating back to the discussion of Owlite academy and Valkyrian armors. Considering 2 following aspects:

- Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Facory only recently started to produce fire-themed weapons, and by the far more hazardous design of Red Roarmulus Twins, the elemental direction is less developed
- Shadow weapons on the other hand are kept to upper echelons of gremlin society - such as Dark Retribution, as supposedly lasers. Yet, those devices are seem to be more consistent in their design. Presence of shadow elements and Underworld's symbology while is subtle, but consistent with the rest of technology.

We can make an educated guess that Cradle's defenses did consist of the same laser technology found in the factory, but, due to subtle coloring, also imbued with shadows.

Yet, it is through the analysis of the events preceding the infiltration of the factory we can discover the scope of gremlin technology and advancements which we see as thematically consistent with the earlier case of laser technology acknowledging multitude of other motifs and preestablished laws of physics across Cradle.

- `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R.` (desc: [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

    Power grid is hidden within the toxic cavern and contains a hull of an inactive Roarmulus Twin. The power complex itself, in its purpose is reminiscent of Razwog's facility, as in both cases the centerpoint is the power cords leading up to the mission's key element, either being the generator, or the first glance of Roarmulus Twins' design.
- `Intel had reported a gremlin deconstruction crew dismantling a portion of the Clockworks in order to generate scrap resources for use in their Project R. Using powerful welding torches, they are truly burning the place to the ground. One of the squads investigating the site has gone missing and is believed to be now held in captivity at the site. Infiltrate the fiery deconstruction zone and rescue the captive knights. But be warned, the deconstruction crew are said to have a powerful security construct hidden somewhere on site.` (desc: [High Temperature Hostages](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/High_Temperature_Hostages)). It suggests, that the process of Project R construction is done with a high pace.

    It is also here [oilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Oiler) are found, with a visible presence of abundant slime, seen previously in the context of the document in the end of Herex's compound 42.
- `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out. Spiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down.` (desc: [Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)).

It is here we should delve into the final assessment of the wood found across Clockwoks.

##### Twisting Trees and Wyverns

Here we build upon the previous introduction of ironwood and other types of wood, as ones with fictional properties. It is within the context of Roarmulus Twins Redwood and other types of trees are also worth noting outside of the analysis of alchemy of ironmight equipment specifically due to the context of [Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil) mission: `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out.`

Gremlins were harvesting trees of [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles), described as twisting. At the end of the mission knight is rewarded with the [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet). This seems as a direct connection between the type of wood of those twisting trees and the bracelet, both being made of redwood. Extrapolating this idea on other types of wood, we can make a solid suggestion that all of those twisting trees correspond to types of wood found across Clockworks due to existence of other types of bracelets - [driftwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) and [ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet), - but also suggest that those trees were present during the existence of the Ironmight kingdom, be it already on Cradle or a different planet, potentially in place of [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles) as both are practically identical.

Then there is the [Wyrmwood bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet). All of bracelets made of wood grant resistance to shock, and they have a parity to according materials based on naming convention, color, and star rating. Among them Wyrmwood bracelet is only 5-tar trinket, and there is no 5-star variant of wood, as ironwood is the last material in this roster, being 4 stars. We suggest, that is a type of wood which is called wyrmwood.

But, wyrmwood in real world is not wood. If looked from a context of other bracelet trinkets, they make wyrmwood seem as a different type of wood, one surpassing ironwood in its properties, based on the star rating. We can also figure out what wyrmwood looks like based on other bracelets:

- [Driftwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) has pale brown color scheme, as driftwood inventory icon. Drioftwood bracelet it is acquired for 5 forge sparks.
- [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet) has bright red color scheme, while redwood inventory icon has pale red or pink color. redwood bracelet is acquired for 20 forge sparks.
- [Ironwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet) same as ironwood inventory icon has metallic grey color scheme. Ironwood bracelet is acquired for 50 forge sparks.
- [Wyrmwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet) is bright green and is acquired for 100 forge sparks.

As it was mentioned, wyrmwood is not wood, but its name is translated to wormwood, reminiscent of dragons and their sub-species in earlier sections, when existence of wyverns was suggested. Considering a more fantastic setting of Spiral Knights and more direct inspiration and naming parity of names, here we suggest, a parallel can be drawn between wyrmwood, wyverns, celestial ore, and sun silver, going beyond bitter taste of real world wormwood.

One particular inspiration we suggest taking place here. Ironwood is a forest in norse mythology, inhabited by jotun. We have previously suggested that in the context of norse mythology, valkyries of heavenly kingdom could have interacted with tortomega. At the same time gremlins were harvesting redwood from the floating isles, which we have established to belong to tortomega based on its' ruins designs and gun puppy statues. Tortomega, as constructs, drop sun silver, which we have proposed being refined celestial ore, relation to heavens due to its description.

So, could it be that wyrmwood is an instance of the heavenly wood? We believe, considering its presence, it could. The fact that this wood grants most protection of shock status, seem to suggest its origins connected to sky, such as owlites' developments and storm chaser elemental. Here a connection to heavens also could be established though the presence of wyverns, potential descendants of dragons, which we have concluded being a unique specie.

As for the Roarmulus Twins, we suggest that at least ironwood was harvested to construct its armor. It is unknown weather wyrmwood was intended to be used, but, judging of different properties of wood, it is likely to possess a far different set of attributes, rather than ones used to construct sturdy armor.

##### Gun Puppies: From Dragons to Red Roarmulus Twins

We have proposed, the tier 1 gun puppies were made of stone, designed and created by descendants of dragons - tortomega, to imitate dragons. Howlitzers became undead drakes. Tier 2 and 3 variants are manufactured by gremlins.

This idea is based on the design of tier 1 gun puppies, specifically, their outer shells being made of stone as well as lacking more complex metal designs of the rest of gremlin constructs, apart from lumbers.

As with the topic of the collector, elemental gremlin technology is also present for gun puppies and rocket puppies. Specifically in the form of elemental variants. By that we mean only tier 1 gun puppies were invented by tortomega, as only they possess consistent stone design, without any complex forms or separate jaw, as tier 2 and above, and elemental variants.

It can be argued that rocket puppy is on the same primitive design, but it would seem anachronistic fot tortomega utilize rockets. But, even this argument considered, tortodrones can be brought up, as they are the most effective demonstration of military abilities of tortomega civilization, albeit focused on minerals and stone. Consuidering it, we lean to tier 1 rocket puppies being also of that older age.

Elemental gun puppies, on the other hand, do not have bolted foundation and generally look more arcane with spiral design incorporated in their every aspect. But here we should note a common element found across many manufactured equipment - the 3-dot triangular shape present, which is unique for high-tech equipments and devices.

##### Red Roarmulus Twins

Apart from those design, we should look at both Roarmulus Twins and Red Roarmulus twins. In this context the latter are far more hazardous looking, as they seem structurally unstable as well as lacking any gremlin writings present on regular Roarmulus Twins. The description of the shadow Ironclaw munition factory with the design of it's enemies seem to suggest that it is not an uncommon design choice, but rather extrapolated onto larger constructs, reminiscent of more deteriorated state of corrupted tortodrones and elemental gun puppies, as if the introduction of elemental amplifies one aspects of the construction and reduces the other, design-wise.

And it is through gun puppies we can observe an extent to which gremlin technology taps into elemental properties, but also shadow, which will be important in relation to the design of Clockworks proper.

[Red Rovers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Red_Rover) and [regular Gun Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Gun_Puppy) are in a unique position as they have boss variants presented as Roarmulus Twins. While gun puppies might not be of such great interest for us, apart from mentioned gremlin writings on the armor plates, the Red Roarmulus Twins are. In reality, those writings can be distinguished only through direct view of the Red Roarmulus Twins' texture, which does seem as they are not intended to be seen.

Red Rovers have an attack same as Lord Vanaduke in his last phase, which partially demonstrates the extent of powers of the cursed entity. But, at that, only tier 3 red rovers are seen to be explicitly burning, with visible glow between the joints of the armor plates, as well as glowing slab on top. Red Roarmulus twins have only external layer of armor plates damaged by fire, while the internal components are seemingly red-hot, similar to red rovers. At that, the construction of lasers is also unique, as they are red, which are encountered only one more time in Warmaster Seerus's chamber.

The very existence of far more hazardous construction of the facility, as well as the state of Red Roarmulus Twins, we believe, demonstrates the extent at which elemental properties can be integrated in gremlin technology, albeit with a greater risks of the resulting constructing seeming more unstable, that is judging by Red Roarmulus Twins' and elemental gun puppies' designs.

#### Jelly Kingdom and Slimes

For the first time lichens and the existence of slime family of monsters was introduced in [Alien Ooze mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze), where Spiral Order has concluded, that lichens had arrived on a meteor: `Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle.` (desc: [Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)).

There are 2 distinct categories of slimes in the slime family, - lichens which make up lichen colonies, and jellies. The main factor allowing for such classification is the design of both lifeforms - essentially their viscosity and stability of form as 2 distinguishing factors. We believe, jellies are the descendant, or rather, matured lichens. A following comparison of those species outlines their similarities and distinct features.

Both species have a distinct core. There are instances of multiple cores, making up sentient colonies (desc: `Lichens are an alien species of the slime family ... formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.'` - [Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)), as well as large royal jellies.

A notion could be established here, that of both sentient lichen colonies of multiple cores and larger jellies function as a single, unified organisms, capable of higher mental functions as evident by existence of a monarchy of royal jellies.

This monarchy is embodied by [Jelly King's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_King) and [Ice Quenn's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen) [crowns]((https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown)) having many of common elements of an Imperial Crown.

- `... monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes.` (npc: [Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace))
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and it's king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)
- `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them.` (desc: [Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown))

We known that those core-like objects are called cores based on the line of slime core items, as follows, with several notes:

- [Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core). As it is used in alchemy of [Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm): `Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians.` - we can guess that those jellies' role is likely of guards, as it is those who guard entrance to the [Garden of Goo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Garden_of_Goo) behind [palace's walls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace).
- [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core): `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent.`

  - `A hardy helm crafted from overly oppressive ooze.` (desc: [Brute Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Helm))
  - `A firm set of mucilaginous mail crafted from the remains of particularly antagonistic jellies.` (desc: [Brute Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Mail)) The brute slime in question, considering medieval themes of jelly kingdom and throne, is likely an offensive unit of jelly army.
- [Toxic Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Core): `A solid, pulsating lump that oozes with vitriol.`
- [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core): `A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing.`
- [Rocky Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core): `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior.`

  Considering themes of sturdiness of rock gels:

  - `A tough topper tailored from jagged jelly.` (desc: [Rock Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Helm))
  - `Crafted from the most adamant of slimy specimens, it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights.` (desc: [Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield))
  - `This gelatinous gear combines the sturdiness of stone with the piercing protection of sticky goo. It's a wonder that you managed to beat up the jelly this is made out of.` (desc: [Rock Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Mail))

  We can suggest those being the heavy infantry of the kingdom, as well as them being the closest to royalty, as they have 4-star rarity.
- [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core): `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime.` And attributed to it equipment such as [Royal Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Mail): `A viciously viscous set of armor crafted painstakingly from the most noble specimens of quivering slime.`

These cores demonstrate color variation in types of jellies, but also their properties and taste. The latter is specified by the alchemy tree of jelly shields:

- [Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield): `it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights.`
- `... it is durable, light, and delightfully berry-flavored.` (desc: [Brute Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Shield))

This attribute, with consideration of danger is slime (desc: `Please note that members of the slime monster family (jellies, lichens, polyps, glop drops, Royal Jelly, Ice Queen) are not edible and should not be ingested under any circumstance, despite the fact that some may resemble a confection.` - [Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)), can be explained through a property of not real-world lichen, but of tropical frogs due to the contrast color being a sign of toxicity, as a lead.

It is known that at least lichens arrived on a meteor, and, due to anatomical and biological similarity of jellies and lichens, we consider both being alien to Cradle. Apart from it, jellies, and specifically royal slimes, have visible core as large lichen colonies. Considering the approximate habitats of both species, we propose, that jellies are matured lichens, lichen colonies and polyps, whose development, with the preexisting sentience in the form of colonies allowed for a civilization to emerge, a kingdom.

It is also important to mention a color shift of lichen colonies as they grow larger. Lichen colonies as well as jellies both are also capable of extending their spikes through the ground - this trait is particularly unique in general context to connect both species to a common ancestor, which, as we have suggested, are lichens, specifically yellow lichens.

Under this logic it is the left ambiguous, how so creatures like blast cubes, toxigels, slooms, and by proxy void gels came to existence, as they look and act practically same as lichens, yet have a single larger core. We will keep them in mnd until later discussion.

On the other hand, there are minis, [shankles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shankle), and [glop drops](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glop_Drop), which lack a distinct core:

- Minis are originated of polyps, as implied by the throne room of the Royal Jelly Palace.
- Drops are widespread in compounds and treasure vaults, which contains a third specie of slimes - shankles. Yet, based on the tier 3 designs, there is a possibility of them possessing a core, which can be reshaped, or at least an inner glow.
- Shankles are only specie which have a distinct biological features, such as an eye and mouth. Considering the behavior of mimics, we can suggest those were in proximity of gremlin settlements and facilities. But, they do have an implication of an existing hierarchy, as [Treasute Mimic's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Treasure_Mimic) tendrils have a crown of an imperial design. Through the presence of tendrils and their behavior - as ones emerging from the ground, - we can confirm, that shankles are sub-specie of slimes, diegetically.

##### Gremlin Bioengineering And Purposed Organisms

Across the suggested physiology of slimes, existence of toxins, toxoils, and quicksilvers seem to become more nuanced.

We propose, that during games's event both gremlins and Spiral Order had gained understanding of slime physiology, which allowed for both to develop their own technology. In case of gremlins it is creation of artificial lichens, and for Spiral Order their research resulted in the Slime Node gear.

It is important to establish, which slimes we consider artificial as well as describe the reasoning behind this logic.

##### Blast Cubes

Blast Cubes are first artificial slimes manufactured by gremlins. We believe they are as such due to their unique and unstable property to explode - this characteristic is not observed anywhere else, nor in any slime family.

Yet, blast cubes and explosive blocks, and Collector's bombs seem to have a common nature. This seems less of budget restriction, but an intentional design choice guided by gremlin technological advancements. Yet, while there is existence of a link between compound 42 and toxic gels, there is no such link for blast cubes.

They have a peculiar variation in color, transitioning from yellow, to reddish crimson, and to purple depending on Clockworks tier.  Visible cracked blackened edges on all variants which give impression of cooler areas on top of heated surface, reminiscent of molten metal dross.

In the latter two variants blast cubes possess lightning arcs around the core within the main body of slime.

They they are damaged enough, stability of surrounding slime seem to falter, as more lightnings emerge from the core and confinement of main body of slime across all variants. In the very final moment the core explodes, suggesting that it is the energy source for the slime. This collapse is also characteristic of larger jellies, such as Ice Queen or Jelly King.

##### Diegesis of Explosive Blocks

As Blast Cubes function very similar to Explosive Blocks, we have to look at those within the context of they placement in the story. They are most strangely present in Scarlet Fortress. This becomes a question of their canon, as some elements, such as respawn pads, we believe, are not diegetic. Weather this can be said of explosive blocks, we could not say with full certainty. The same can be attributed to higher tier gun puppies, such as those present in [Firestorm Citadel's Charred Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court). As far as we are aware of gremlin technology, and as we mentioned it previously - a small chance of gremlins attempting to control Firestorm Citadel exists, mainly due to ambiguity of elevators. But in the current context, with those assumptions in mind, we can more certainly say of blast cube's origins.

##### Toxigels, Oilers, Toxoils

Toxins and oilers are placed together mainly due to the events of compound 42.

Based on the memos in the facility (npc: `... it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin.` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), it seems that the biological weapon in question was not intended to become such. But, a plausible explanation can be suggested, as the weapon was derived of slimes.

Event of the Vile Engine seem to suggest that the slime generator, while in-game were seen to produce quicksilver lichens, are in fact capable of both, judging by the outer regions of generators' influence, resulting in creation of the Rotting Metropolis.

As for the oilers, as tubes of oil are found in the eng of the compound seems as an evidence of their artificial nature and the fact toxigels and oilers were mixed to create toxoils unique to compound 42. It is also notable, that, when oiler is ignited, its core also burns, making it visible only in such state. This industrial motif is also present for quicksilver lichens.

##### Quicksilver Lichens

As toxigels and toxoils were purposed to become bioweapons, as blast cubes were devised as mobile bombs, as oiler were used in the heating and smelting facilities, quicksilvers, we believe, are also artificial purposed organisms.

The first element is lichens' name. Quicksilver is an archaic term for mercury. The design of lichens suggest it being true, as quicksilver has same reflective properties.

While a connection between mercury and healing may not relate to anything in particular, it is important to look as other aspects of their design and themes, present across Spiral Order equipment - the [quicksilver armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail) alchemy tree, including [Mercurial Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit).

The persisting theme is one of electricity:

- `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver.` (desc: [Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail)). Despite referring to mercury in the past tense, the mail remain with this name. Quickwilver in this context might mean the lichen, as alchemy of the next in line upgrade - [Charged quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) contains all of the familiar slime-related materials, such as gel cores, [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core) and [Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core), and potentially [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil) specifically.
- [Charged Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) is a direct upgrade of the prior with instruction of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) into its alchemy.

    The description of [its charged helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Helm) - `An enhanced Quicksilver Helm conductive to the destruction of electrical foes.` - might suggest that it is a state of armor, or rather, mercury itself, within which charged quicksilver lichens are encountered.
- The final upgrade, [Mecrurial Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail) - `A supreme set of silver armor that'll put a spring in your step while keeping shocks out of it.`, and [Mercurial Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Helm) - `A sublime silver helmet that'll let you move as swiftly as water, though perhaps not quite so swiftly *through* it.` have an emphasis on this armor's defense supremacy and speed.
- Same characteristic of speed is found in the [Mercurial Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit) set: `A demo suit made from gremlin technology. It is for the bomber that wants a boost of speed, more power and a greatly reduced chance of dying by electrocution ...`

    While it is indeed stated that the armor utilizes gremlin technology, most prominently [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium) - `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines. It constantly emits an unsettling hissing sound.` we propose that there is greater symbolic and alchemical meaning to be found, which will be analyzed after the initial coverage of Clockworks' infrastructure.

But currently, as far as initial role of quicksilver lichens go, they seem to represent a utilitarian role of batteries, as their gel os found across complex, highly dangerous facilities, specifically, [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory). Moreover, quicksilver lichens are produced by [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) during the Vile Engine mission.

We have already discussed the nature of the Rotting Metropolis, using it to interpret existence of those generator in favour of Herex. Yet, the description `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them.` (desc: [The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)) is particularly vague.

Despite both subspecies of lichens being artificial, we can't currently explain this inconsistency, apart from it being an implication of an artificial nature of both quicksilver lichens and toxigels.

##### Node Field

To known characteristics of slime family, [nodes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352), specifically Node Field, as suggested by a [Node Field aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) serves as an artificial analogue. We believe creation of node field, powered by the energy, is Spiral Order's attempt in artificial creation of slime for means of protection.

Considering that the gel core is essential to lichens and jellies, with exception of minis and shankles, it serves essentially as a heart and nerve center, as those make up sentient colonies. Gel Core is plausibly capable of producing slime gel, similar to bone marrow. In case of Spiral Order Node equipment, the slime is held stable by 2 elements - a gel core, and an element which likely contains energy, and is present across most of regular gear.

Within this context node slime equipment - [Guards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Guards), [Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Mask), [Crusher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Crusher), [Wall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Wall), - all of those items, as previous batch of gear such as [Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield), contain a core. But here it is far more distinct, it pulses energy in a specific pattern. This glowing pattern can be extended to an [aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura). But, both node Field and internal translucent structure of [Royal Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield) alchemy tree is very similar, except for the lack of completely connected geometry with no loose nodes.

Here also a definitive design element of slime alchemy is found - in case of the equipment, such as  [Jelly Sheild](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Shield), to alchemize if both slime's core and gel are required. [Node Container](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Container) has a specific role, mainly due to combination of its name and function - to contain and potentially stabilize the gel, held together by the glowing cores in the same manner as the energy symbol on shields is meant to convey their underlying technology and diegetic game mechanic of spherical shield, and as gel cores are essential for larger slimes.

One particular element then remains, that of [Node Field aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) itself, as it extends past the knight into the surroundings. At the same time, the [promotional material](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box#Calendar) also depicts what seems to be Node Field covered chamber.

Due to this design choice we lean to a conclusion that the Node Field, at first, is a technology. But, as its design differs greatly from the rest of Spiral Order equipment, we have to assume that it is derived from a different place and time, as far as this concept can go. And to hold the structure of the gel itself through those artificial means, [Gel Glue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Glue) was manufactured: `A viscous compound developed by Biotechs to allow for the study of slime creatures. When mixed with slime and jelly matter, it allows for reshaping without losing its form. Though reserved for scientific purposes, the process is generally regarded as 'super fun'.`

##### Starlight Cradle and Ancient Titans

Then, there is Starlight Cradle, while it is of the same nature as the rest of Aurora Isles, it is distinguished by the presence of sleep mist, instrumental to its design, feel, and themes: `Beneath a moonlit sky azure islands drift in a sea of stars. These islands are home to creatures that are more than happy to creep upon those who succumb to this world's endless lullaby.` (desc: [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle)).

Meteor motif within this region in particular is more so interesting, as is it on meteor lichens were supposed to arrive, and the region has Meteor Mile in 3 different variants of a fixed layout. This seems intentional, both in naming and design. Not particularly related to the region, a [scenario room with a smoldering meteor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Lichenous_Lair_1.png) exist, but, it seems to be too recent of an event, due to burning fires. Due to this, we believe that this is not the original meteor lichens had arrived on Cradle, but, one related. Keeping this in mind, there is also Torporal Titan, but before it, we must look at properties of the gear, alchemized from this region's materials. It is also here, at Meteor Mile 2, we can see a direct parallel and common motif of both Gun Puppy constructs and gun puppy statues placed nearby.

Among currently present sequences of levels, only Torporal Titan lacks a narrative in its name. [Stygian Steeds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Stygian_Steeds) were present during the events of the Return of Ur, as the stygian, or Underworld, steeds are trojans of the legion of Ur, as they were sealed in the Underworld. And [Briar Bone Barrage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Concrete_Jungle/Briar_Bone_Barrage) is seemingly named after a unique encounter with [Toxilargow](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxilargo#Toxilargow), but here we can rely on previous levels, whose names mark the extent of the poisonous miasma.

The location of Starlight Cradle is more structurally intact compared to the rest of the regions of, initially, the same biome. As the rest of Aurora Isles, this region had also been populated by tortomega, but, due to relation to meteors and unique state lichens are found in, it was overtaken by the latter in the same manner as royal jelly palace. Potentilly being the source of all lichens. Yet, this would not explain nature of sleep here, which we will analyze next.

Themes of stars and sleep are related. Most of the related to this location gear uses [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core) (desc: `A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing.` - [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core)) in its alchemy:

- [Starlit Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Suit) 5-star armor has usage of both [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core), a 5-star slime-themed material, and [Meteor Mote](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Meteor_Mote), which is stated to be used by gremlins: `A small piece of a rare material that is said to have fallen from the sky. Gremlins typically use it in the construction of power sources.`

    This further suggests this region being related to meteors in the context of lichens' arrival to Cradle. Considering that the meteor had to end up at Cradle's surface, and the Aurora Isles are particularly aerial region, this might not be a coincidence, but an intentional decision for both explaining lichens' origins and to disclose more regions of tortomega civilization beyond Wildwoods and general Aurora Isles.

    The latter, notably, we now know are the place of Ironwood to be harvested, relating back to the question of the resources required to potentially construct tortodrones in the first place, and then Roarmulus Twins by gremlins. The fact meteor mote is stated to be used by gremlins, the way we see it, is the expansion upon the industrial application of lichens.

    Although, this could simply be the fact gremlins harvest all of natural resources, unrelated to lichens.
- `An advanced, star-soaked hunting coat that will keep you awake even as it coddles you in downy comfort.` (desc: [Starlit Hunting Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Coat)). A wording of star-soaked is peculiar - as it is unknown weather this is a metaphor. If this property is to be interpreted literally, then, we are thinking of the sleep-inducing mist, naturally secreted by [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo).

  This mist then is addressed directly:

  - `A powerful alchemical bomb that creates a thick fog of sleepy mist.` (desc: [Slumber Squall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Squall))
  - `A Slumber Smogger modified to disperse sleepy smog over a wider range.` (desc: [Slumber_Smogger_Mk_II](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger_Mk_II))
  - `An alchemical bomb that fogs an area with a sleep agent.` (desc: [Slumber Smogger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger))
  - `An illuminated helm strengthened against soporific smogs. It's surprisingly soft inside.` (desc: [Starlit Demo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Helm))
  - `An advanced hunting cap, illuminated and downy, that resists the strongest sleep mists.` (desc: [Starlit Hunting Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Cap))

  The nature of this mist will be important later.
- `Something has really riled up the Chromalisks in the levels below the town of Emberlight. Spiral HQ sent a squad in to investigate and they quickly fell off the radar. Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. Biotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core.` (desc: [In Cold Blood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood)). This mission ends in the location, by the gate icon and by its design, in the Starlight Cradle - [Lizard Lounge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood/Lizard_Lounge).
- [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo) have a unique design of spikes, which are covered with ornamen glowing patterns.

    This shattered or cracked design is similar to other entities, such as [Gorgos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo#Gorgo), Margrel, [corrupted tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone), and [trojans](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan). Although all of those examples are some of other way relate to Underworld, we believe this case, sleep is not related to Underword, but it demonstrates a potentially different concept.
- Items of [Slumber Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Prize_Box) also relate to this region through the color scheme.
- [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox) also contains trinkets relating to a time of day - 3-star [Early Riser Ring](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Early_Riser_Ring), 4-star [Dawn Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dawn_Bracelet), 5-star [Daybreaker Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band), all being synonyms of dawn.
- [Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_shield) alchemy tree, including [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise), provide sleep resistance.

    We have earlier proposed, that [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise) was designed by Owlites, but, there're no evidence of lichens existing that far into the past, not evidence of Owlites combating lichens. Although, it would not conflict with the existing timeline of events. More potential connections arise from earlier upgrades - `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell. It's tough enough to dull a jelly barb on impact.` (desc: [Wild Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Shell)). In fact, we still do not known the nature of explicitly hardened shells derived of tortodrones.

    As for the regular, jelly, line of upgrades, we are out of valid explanations for their nature, apart from a potential concept of lichens originating from this mist-covered biome, but this would conflict with an aforementioned scenario room of a meteor, as only regular lichens emerge from the meteor.
- [Purrfect Katnip Pouch](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Purrfect_Katnip_Pouch) provides sleep resistance and is acquired for 100 [Primal Sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), design-wise it is fitting.
- [Somnambulist's totem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem): `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo.` Naming of a totem is peculiar, as there are only 2 other instances of a totem naming scheme being used, - gremlin and Underworld devices. As Apocrea was mention within the [memorandum](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472), and we have briefly mentioned it, here, we can focus on this concept. This naming of a totem within the context of Apocrea could be referencing Lovecraft's shot story "Hypnos" and broader Dream Cycle.

We propose that at the center of region's identity and reason for it's in-universe existence is the nature of the sleep mist, and it is one derived from tortomega. This connection we make due to the earlier lack of context for the Torporal Titan. Naming convention of titan is very rare and is used selectively upon items and places with at least some background:

- For ancient equipment acquired for Almitian Seals: [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) and [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm), it was relation to moss and immense - titanic (desc: `A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength.` - [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm)), - strength, affirmed by the slowness of movement, as the items were made of stone. Here we remember th Ironmight set, which design and buff-wise is similar, yet relates to different epoch of Ironmight kingdom, yet still heavy to induce slowness. It should be noted, that ancient equipment is also detrimental to sleep status effect.
- Titan gates were a key to establishing titans, tortomega, and creators of tortodrones, as a single specie.

And here, [Tortporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan) is an unchanging depth of 3 arenas within a seemingly intact location. Considering the context of the location, designed as the rest of Aurora Isles, we believe, this naming convention was intentional. While sleep may be related to titan, that it most likely sleeps, we do not know anything apart from it.

##### Ice Queen

Ice Queen and rest of [Ice Cubes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Cube#Ice_Cube) can be grouped together as both have same freeze-related nature. Ice Cubes in particular can be re-frosted through application of frost status effect. As everfrost is extracted from freeze-themed enemies, and if anything, the state Royal Jelly Palace found in, that is most reminiscent of frozen Amu-Sol due to Everfost's influence, we believe the prior is the same case. As Maulos was involved with Amu-Sol, we suggest freezing of Royal Jelly Palace being of Ice Queen's doing, rather than a natural phenomenon, due to innate nature of Ice Cubes, as they are capable of generating ice on their own will.

Then there is presence of evil eye on Ice Queen's crown, seen both of her variant, and one alchemized in the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine - we rely on it through connection to everfrost, as both had originated from the Underworld. The crown itself is made of [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), as suggested by the description of the latter: `. It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty.` (desc: [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). It was stated that slimes had overtaken the palace, so it could mean, in conjunction with usage of the ore in valkyrian armor, [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) specifically, that Ice Queen had found the ore as heavenly kingdom had long gone, and created a crown.

#### Mending Rune and Gremlin Emblem

Gremlin Mending rune is identical to gremlin classification image and also, as it seems from the general appearances of this symbol, is an internally consistent image across gremlin clans. Based on the fact that Crimson Order imagery is consistent across the facilities, we suggest that this more generalized symbol of the rune is the emblem of the Great Colony or Iron Law itself, as all known clans abide to it and by proxy Crimson Order and king Tinkinzar.

Weather it is Great Colony's emblem or symbol of order, might be resolved through the design of [Gremlin Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Prize_Box). It is similar to the depiction of the familiar Spiral Order symbol on the [Raider Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box). More important is the design of [Gremlin Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Suit), as on its sleeves there is symbol belonging to the Spiral Order, rather than gremlins.

Due to this, we can also suggest that the Great Colony is a term for a type of military organizational structure, similar to Spiral Order of Isorians. Althouth the quote `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely.` (desc: [Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)) could question this interpretation. At the same time, one could be banished from the Order, a discharge or dismissal. Within this context a position of Emberlight gremlins as traitors seems fitting. Within this theory we will consider Great Colony as a location, a metropolis.

As for the rune and its healing properties, it can be applied by gremlin menders to both other living entities as well constructs, including battlepods. In its behavior it resembles healing field of Silkwings, and the rune's emblem shimmers as the dread seal. Menders cast that rune through usage of a wrench equipped with luminite shard, which may point to identity of the principle behind healing.

There are also [healing totems](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Healing_Totem#Healing_Totem), found in the Firestorm Citadel after Nature Sprites had began putting out the fires. Those totems also resemble wrenches with mineral shards held within, which function as passive mending. As for their purpose, considering Herex's presence with a large squad of both gremlins and constructs, we suggest totems' placement here is the evidence of them passing through this route.

The color of minerals held in those wrenches is also notable, as those contain dark matter. But, as the alloy is a less consistent application of minerals, compared to the rest, wherein gremlins use only a single type of mineral, it is likely to be, in fact, charged luminite, as mentioned for the first time in the context of [Sun Shards bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards): `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite. Whatever you do, don't look directly at it.` (desc: [Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards)).

Gremlins utilize all minerals in their weapons. Most common example here are the gremlin knockers, which are equipped with 2 wrenches, but each with a different mineral. It seems that it is the interaction between those minerals which causes an explosion, which is weaponized:

- [Knocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Knocker): moonstone and crimsonite, no status effect
- [Lighter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Lighter): crimsonite and luminite, causes fire
- [Cooler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Cooler): valestone and moonstone, causes frost
  - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb) consists of moonstone and valestone alloy, elemental damage (desc: `A large chunk of Moonstone and Valestone alloy primed with a potent explosive. Studies have shown that this bomb can be used to reduce a zombie's craving for brains by up to 100% by blowing them to pieces.` - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb))
- [Choker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Choker): valestone and dark matter, causes poison
- [Jumper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Jumper): moonstone and dark matter, causes shock

Notably, those are the uncommon-type combinations of minerals found across Clockworks, as evident by the [mineral frequency table](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Acquisition), with moonstone-crimsonite being attributed rather to general gremlin stratum. Could it be, this strategic placement of minerals is explained by the explosive nature of their interactions? But then, why frequent minerals are also present in those speculated to be dangerous combinations?

This emerging relation between minerals' themes, their natures, tethered by their application across Isorian and Gremlin technology made us think of a different notion, of concept of Five Elements in Godai.

Although interpretation within the context of fictional reality of Spiral Knights will differ, we will attempt to look for similarities and common themes, such as the aforementioned relations of statuses and minerals.

For that, minerals' descriptions should be brought to the shortest description:

- Crimsonite - passion, anger, strength
- Dark Matter - chaos, nothingness
- Luminite - faith, wisdom, zeal
- Moonstone - knowledge
- Valestone - essence of life

Dark matter is described as as essence of both chaos and nothingness. We have already discussed how this duality relates back to western alchemy. But what we have not mentioned up until now is the relation to Godai and its concept of the Void or Ku, as its fifth element, in most layman terms here being the abstract of the being, it is the spirit, cosmic Heaven, and Aether. We must point out, Ku currently has no relation to the Void of Whitespace of Spiral Knights, but it has very similar cosmic motif, as Energy is also ever-present.

As here we have to operate though metaphor in far greater aspect, due to topic's nature, we have to be even more careful. At that, we consider minerals in question being embodiments of those principles.

In more metaphorical sense, the very fact of attempting to establish nature of those minerals, while a general understanding was established, we came to a conclusion, best articulated by Carl Jung in the english translation of "Psychology and Alchemy": `The mistaken idea of a merely outward imitatio Christi is further exacerbated by a typically European prejudice which distinguishes the Western attitude from the Eastern. Western man is held in thrall by the "ten thousand things"; he sees only particulars, he is ego-bound and thing-bound, and unaware of the deep root of all being. Eastern man, on the other hand, experiences the world of particulars, and even his own ego, like a dream; he is rooted essentially in the "Ground," which attracts him so powerfully that his relations with the world are relativized to a degree that is often incomprehensible to us. The Western attitude, with its emphasis on the object, tends to fix the ideal—Christ—in its outward aspect and thus to rob it of its mysterious relation to the inner man. It is this prejudice, for instance, which impels the Protestant interpreters of the Bible to interpret (referring to the Kingdom of God) as "among you" instead of "within you." I do not mean to say anything about the validity of the Western attitude: we are sufficiently convinced of its rightness. But if we try to come to a real understanding of Eastern man — as the psychologist must — we find it hard to rid ourselves of certain misgivings. Anyone who can square it with his conscience is free to decide this question as he pleases, though he may be unconsciously setting himself up as an arbiter mundi.`

#### Clockworks and Magitek

When speaking of Clockworks, inevitably Core and Architect had to be brought up as essentials. Here we will attempt to parse them, working downwards from the most present in-game elements.

We begin with the [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser), which as we remember was the Spark of Life before energy system rework (desc: `The old ‘Spark of Life’ crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). Now it is important.

- [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser) is referenced in [Elecron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) as a payload of unstable organic essence (desc: `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` - [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)).
- It is used in creation of [Voltedge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Voltedge): `Combining Spiral capacitor technology with samples recovered from the Ironclaw Munitions Factory produced the blade, which can output a particularly hazardous 1.21 gigawatt discharge.`

    This would mean that Roarmulus Twins' laser canons utilize Storm Chasers to power themselves, as it the rarities 5-star material, attributed to shock-themed enemies.

Due to this, we can suggest that [Red Roarmulus Twins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Red_Roarmulus_Twins) utilize [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), as a fiery counterparts to shock. And yet, the suggestion gremlins use flame souls is confirmed by alchemy and description of [Combuster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Combuster): `Combining the principles of the Skylark's engines with the technology powering the Blast Furnace produced this brutal blade, which can ignite even the most flame-retardant materials at a distance.` We can identify the  technology powering Blast Furnaces through the analysis of the rest of alchemy line of Combuster:

`An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of fire.` (desc: [Fireburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fireburst_Brandish)). The only material which is added to this 3-star blade, compared to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish), is [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone): `A small rock that smolders constantly. Gremlins patrolling the Cooling Chambers occasionally use them as a hand warmer.` We can guess that it is a magic-infused material, due to its description. It is also the one material used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield). [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield) are the only shield with visible patterns as of breakable battlepod hexagonal shields. Battlepod's shield are notably pink, which, through the color scheme of the prior 2 transmutable shields, the way we see it, highly suggests being made with usage of dark matter, as fiery variant is orange, as frost variant is light-blue.

As [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone) is used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield), so [Hailstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone) is used for [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield). This stone, same as its fiery counterpart, contains elemental energy, as suggested by the description of [Iceburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iceburst_Brandish): `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of ice.` - a 3-star upgrade to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish). Followed by it 4-star upgrade - [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand) is described as `A high-tech blade that fuses Spiral and Clockwork Technology. It can produce a concentrated low-temperature explosion that is harmless to knights.` (desc: [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand)), which is now a copy-paste pattern for brandishes, which is evident by the material in question - [Perfect_Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball). Although we can argue, as it is also acquired for 10 [primal spars](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), it a magical material, but definitely not a Clockwork Technology, unless such items as [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) were made within Clockworks.

The 5-star upgrade of 4-star [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand) is [Glacius](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacius): `Mixing some advanced theories on cryogenics with the technology powering the Cooling Chamber produced this advanced armament, which is capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes.` New 5-star material is [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost). The description of the blade `... capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes ...` matches now known powers of everfrost.

Backing to [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield),
[Surge Breaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surge_Breaker_Shield) introduces a greater importance of shock status within gremlin technology. It is transmuted through introduction of [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil): `A slippery substance that always holds a slight electrical charge.` Rather than being of gremlins' invention, Volt Oil is suggested to be Spiral Technology, in the description of [Kilowatt Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar): `A Pulsar upgraded with Spiral technology to deliver an unpleasant shock on impact. Pulsar shots become more powerful the further they travel.` But, it is still elemental essence of lightning, as 3-star [Shockburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shockburst_Brandish) describes addition of Volt Oil: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of lightning.` 4-star upgrade, [Boltbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boltbrand), introduces [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball): `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places.` Here we also can guess that this material was initially identified by Spiral Order due to [Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor): `The addition of an advanced Spiral power source gives this bomb a shockingly large blast radius.` as it is a 4-star upgrade of [Lightning Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lightning_Capacitor). Despite it, the technology of large, bomb-like capacitors belongs to gremlins - [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor): `An explosive device of Gremlin origin designed to produce a deadly field of electricity.` Within this context usage of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) in [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb) - `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` - likely suggests its recreation through usage of the Isorian electric material.

Regarding [Pulsars](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar), most of their instances within the alchemy tree stem from Spiral Order research, as gremlins rarely mentioned. Yet, the original 2-star [Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar) is described as gremlin technology: `A high-tech Gremlin firearm originally designed for use by elite squads of Ironclaw soldiers ...` (desc: [Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar)).

[Catalyzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer) in that regard, contain seemingly the same underlying technology, judging by design of both weapon itself and its projectiles: `An advanced alchemical armament adapted from Gremlin mining and demolition devices. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage.` (desc: [Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer)). Due to its projectiles looking essentially as moonstone versions of dark matter-themed Seerus's [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution), we can confidently relate them to a single nature. It's also here we revisit [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb) due to a similar pattern of orbiting sphere, although here they are not glowing nor pulsing - yet, as we have concluded it being of gremlin origin, this design pattern fits well with the established theme. Due to them using potentially essences, nd the fact Dark Retribution and Arkus hold the same type of projectiles, we suggest that those are connected by the supernatural nature and stem from a common nature of energy and souls.

As for rest of bombs, paralleling [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor), those are all invented by Spiral Order, as all are described as alchemical bombs: [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Venom Veiler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Veiler), [Torpor Tantrum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torpor_Tantrum), [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni), [Stagger Storm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stagger_Storm): `Though it was originally developed by the Spiral Order to harmlessly subdue dangerous species, how you deal with foes unfortunate enough to be caught in the storm is entirely up to you.` [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni) in that context seems to be a real-world Hindu deity adapted into Isorian folklore.

The rest of catalyzer-derived weaponry includes toxic, yet radioactive, [Toxic Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Catalyzer): `A Catalyzer modified to fire dangerously radioactive projectiles. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` and unmodified, less safe and less stable [Volatile Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volatile_Catalyzer): `Removing the safety overrides from a piece of Gremlin technology is a good way to lose a limb ...` seem to suggest that the original catalyzer is designed as gremlins intended, rather than being a Spiral Order modification. It is also here must be noted the extent of Spiral Order engineering, utmost demonstrated by [Virulent Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Catalyzer): `The incorporation of Spiral technology has given this harrowing handgun a powerfully poisonous payload.` That is with the consideration of this gun being also radioactive.

To address the second part of this section - [Magitek](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek), - based on all of those uses of magic, elemental, materials, we can make a conclusion, that gremlin indeed utilized most of known physics for the construction of Clockworks. It is the definition of the concept of Magitek, although one dependent on the definition of magic in the concrete fiction. As for the cosmology of Spiral Knights, its vagueness in some of its aspects, this seems as a definitive, application of this concept, without presence of most discrete and concrete laws of the Unoverse, especially, its other realms.

In order to maintain Clockworks, several complexes are built across it:

- Blast furnaces of clockworks are built and used to melt raw planetary mass. It was built with the usage of [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul).
- Cooling Chamber to maintain Power Complexes across the Clockworks
- Power Complexes used to wire adn distribute the energy of the Core across the Clockworks and to the surface.
- Wasteworks were collecting residue from smelting and operation of Clockworks as well as the Great Colony.

##### Undead Dreadnoughts

A side note on electricity here also must be made - as [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) and [Frankenzoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom) seem to be manufactured entities. As for the latter is seems more of a gimmick, the dreadnought raises a question. As we have covered in the context of Graveyards, only Carnavons and Slug Walkers have a distinct armor, reminiscent of Almire. Frankenzons have a design of augmentations, seen as shoulder pads and wires pathways on the chest and spine, as well as bolts on the head. All [Bombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surging_Bombie#Bombie) have a familiar 3-dot shape, suggesting that they were experimented upon, potentially of the same Iron Hulk, as it is most supernatural of all places relating to shock, even compared to the Power Complexes. Finally, [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) have unique design of shoulder pads and arm guards, as they have single, highly futuristic design. This could be the reason for the containment of Dry Docks, as a valuable asset for the production of shock-infused undead, which should not be too alien to gremlins, as they are involved with devilites.

So, all Dreadnoughs have an armor, apart from the Almirian Guards, which have proper crusader armor. While this factor, we believe, contributes to the nature of zombies as Isorians, and Carnavons belonging to Almire, Dreadnoughts remain. Here we will look into the design of resurrection by grim totems - as it is required for zombies' head only to remain in order to be resurrected.

We suggest, that the reason behind existence of dreadnoughts is two-fold:

- Being heavy infantry of Almire, a parallel to the setting of Warhammer 40k can be drawn, wherein cuh units of Astartees were called [Dreadnoughts](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Dreadnought)
- An application of an pop-cultural concept and a spirit of Japanese mythology - [Gashadokuro](https://yokai.com/gashadokuro/). The key element here is the ability to assemble themselves from the bones of improperly buried, which is fitting for Almire, as well as the general theme of spirits returning to the material realm. As for their armor, we suggest it being of the same phenomenon as Lord Vanaduke's armor, of supernatural origin. We can also male a guess, that the fact dreadnoughts are presented in front of tiles of bones in the Overgrown Court of Shadowplay, we can link those two.

Those two factors, we believe, can explain their nature.

##### Alchemy

As it was stated earlier, electricity seems to be regarded as one of more important aspects of Clockworks' design, up to the point of its presence as lightnings above the Core at depth 29, and within the Unknown Passage, wherein same arcs of lightning are now integrated with the nature of the Swarm. Lighnings and abundance of power is predominantly focused within Power Complex-type Clockwork tunnels.

Power Complexes are populated by shock-themed enemies, including quicksilver lichens. Quicksilver in alchemy was often associated with the concept of the Prima Materia, and represented the soul. The dual nature of mercury, whish is essentially quicksilver, - both a liquid metal and a toxic substance, - contributed to its symbolism in alchemy, representing both transformation and danger. This points us to further presence of dualities within Clockworks. Alchemists of western cultures sought to understand and manipulate these transformative properties in their quest for the philosopher's stone and the secrets of creation of matter and achieving immortality.

Following this idea of alchemical symbolism and prior knowledge of magitek, we can make an educated guess on the nature of Energy. As we have proposed, Energy is derived from the Nameless Realm and energy was associated with the concept of salt through its symbolism.

Salt, in alchemy, in one of its many interpretation, is one of three primes. Essentially, it is one of elements from which all of matter is built. Yet, the more prominent ide of energy as omnipresent in its different forms relates to a different concept in alchemy of Prime Matter.

Here we should note on the alchemy station across Cradle and Clockworks. Their design is of Clockworks rather than of Spiral Order. We have previously proposed, that the concept of energy and later of Spiral is a universal constant. This way we explained seemingly unrelated presence of energy - or salt - symbol on both Isorian and Valkyrian armors. Through the identification of Forgotten time, we have suggested a deeper relation between Isorians and celestial beings, which could've been Owlites in heavenly kingdom, their sharing of technology and designs.

Then there was symbol of orbs of alchemy. As it is depicted on modern alchemy station and tomes of rage, descending from valkyries to a time of existing dragons, we suspect it being a universal phenomenon of matter. Then there is Sancturay Alchemy Station, which explicitly shows this symbol.

Orb os Alphemy are philosopher's stones, as they are the catalyst for the transmutation itself. But, their origins remains unknown, as they are uncraftable. Here, we have to look at their design, one of the same as Cradle, being contained in a golden frame. The interior of alchemy orbs is of bright lights, whose amount increases depending on the rarity of the orb. This theme of gold as a compound and lights we will keep in mind until the [Orbs of Alchemy section](#orbs-of-alchemy).

##### The Prima Materia

We continue with the alchemical symbolism of the Energy, being the prime matter, first matter, the Prima Materia.

Here we will quote english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy" as it is paramount to everything below and around depth 29 of Clockworks.

```md
The basis of the opus, the prima materia, is one of the most famous
secrets of alchemy. This is hardly surprising, since it represents the
unknown substance that carries the projection of the autonomous psychic
content. It was of course impossible to specify such a substance, because
the projection emanates from the individual and is consequently different
in each case. For this reason it is incorrect to maintain that the alchemists
never said what the prima materia was; on the contrary, they gave all too
many definitions and so were everlastingly contradicting themselves. For
one alchemist the prima materia was quicksilver, for others it was ore,
iron, gold, lead, salt, sulphur, vinegar, water, air, fire, earth, blood, water
of life, lapis, poison, spirit, cloud, sky, dew, shadow, sea, mother, moon,
dragon, Venus, chaos, microcosm.

Besides these half chemical, half mythological definitions there are
also some “philosophical” ones which have a deeper meaning. Thus in
the treatise of Komarios1 we find the definition “Hades.” In
Olympiodorus the black earth contains the “accursed of God”
(θεοκατάρατος). The “Consilium coniugii” says that the father of gold
and silver—i.e., their prima materia—is “the animal of earth and sea,” or
“man,” or a “part of man,” e.g., his hair, blood, etc.

The unfettered opposites in chaos. “Chaos” is one of the names for the prima materia.

The mercurial dragon of Greek alchemy, surnamed ἕν τò πᾶν gave
rise to descriptions of the prima materia as Unum, Unica Res, and
Monad and to the statement in the “Liber Platonis quartorum” that man
is well qualified to complete the work because he possesses that which is
simple, i.e., the soul. Mylius describes the prima materia as the
elementum primordiale. It is the “pure subject and the unity of forms,”
and in it any form whatsoever may be assumed (in quo retinetur
quaelibet forma cum possibilitate).

The autonomy and everlastingness of the prima materia in Paracelsus
suggest a principle equal to the Deity, corresponding to a dea mater.

[It] clearly show that the alchemists came to
project even the highest value—God—into matter. With the highest value
thus safely embedded in matter, a starting-point was given for the
development of genuine chemistry on the one hand and of the more
recent philosophical materialism on the other, with all the psychological
consequences that necessarily ensue when the picture of the world is
shifted 180 degrees. However remote alchemy may seem to us today, we
should not underestimate its cultural importance for the Middle Ages.
Today is the child of the Middle Ages and it cannot disown its parents.

The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always
and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and
everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley (c. 1415–90)
writes: “The philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us
the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in
everything, in time and space.” “It offers itself in lowly form [vili
figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].”
According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material
principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the
divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere.
The chaos is a massa confusa that gives
birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden
elemental fire. In the treatise “De sulphure” hell-fire (ignis gehennalis)
is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to
Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all
the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos
confusum, so does the stone.

The idea of the rotating aquasphere
reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle
or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation.
The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise
to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant:
here the σϕαīρος (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars,
owing to the influence of ϕιλία. The definition of this spherical being as
, “the most serene God,” sheds a special light on the
perfect, “round” nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes,
the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis.
The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace
of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. That is why
the prima materia sometimes coincides with the idea of the initial stage
of the process, the nigredo. It is then the black earth in which the gold or
the lapis is sown like the grain of wheat. It is the black,
magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also
called antimony and described as a “black blacker than black” (nigrum
nigrius nigro).
```

From here stems the idea of Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, holding the scales which signify the pondus et mensura. The rotundum is a prefiguration of the gold.

Known as the alchemical Void, the Prima Materia, at it's base form being the Void, and Energy, one which is present in everything across material realm, as shown by Sparks of Life and [Silkwng healing powers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silkwing#Silkwing). Concentration of raw energy drastically amplifies vitality of everything that it surrounds, as evident by the Core's influence, up to if not limited to the transformation of battle sprites. Those alchemical concepts should be kept in mind, as a few elements of gremlin society remain.

##### King Tinkinzar

`The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world.` (npc: [Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Danger Module - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)) is inversion of what seemingly Seerus says in the Engines of War: `The Nine see all, hear all.` and `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!`

Those phrases are found at the monitors with the imagery of Crimson Order symbol. This design pattern, as well as the [previous analysis](#great-colony-and-iron-law) of Iron Law, is reminiscent of Big Brother and his quotes, depicted on the telescreens.

As it was previously pointed out: `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks.` (npc: [Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze)) - it frames Tinkinzar as an embodiment of a particular trope - [the philosopher king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing), a scientist-king, and here, implied creator of Clockworks.

These similarities, as well as the implied longevity and general benevolence of king Tinkinzar in contrast with the realities of gremlin civilization lead us to the conclusion of concept of a great gremlin king being engineered specifically by Crismon Order.

We would have concluded at that, if not for the existence of the Architect:

  `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact))

Due to total absence of any entity remotely reminiscent of the Architect, apart from abstraction of the Swarm, the single and only lead we see - Architect is king Tinkinzar. More similarities arise from notes of the Alpha Squad, framing Clockworks in the similar manner: `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think it's like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow.` (npc: [Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

With this in mind, with the idea of Great Colony, and Iron Law, we can attempt to guess the logic behind the Artifact, its role.

##### Divine and Whitespace Clockworks

The Artifact and Consoles are connected by the fact of working as a key and a lock. Yet, to understand this relation and its precise effects, we are required to be aware of the designs of Whitespace, of what distinguishes it from the rest of depths in detail. We will perform this analysis in multiple iterations, looking as the specific elements.

First, 3 new concepts are introduced by Whitespace, one that is most certainly located within the Core during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares):

- Existence of Whitespace Clockwork tunnels at the start of the [Step Beyond](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond), a platform, reminiscent of the beginning of the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage):

  - Both platform have similar proportions: 9 tiles width, and 9 tiles depth, whitespace version has 10 tiles depth.
  - Both versions have 4x4 4 Clockworks tunnel pillars on each angle of the main platform.
  - Throught the border of the platform goes a single pipe.
  - But, Unknown passage platform has 3 paths extending from it, white Whitespace has only a single path obscured by the different material.
- Transition from the design of Clockwork tunnels to an abstract shapes of cubes of Whitespace proper.
  - It partially reminds of the design choice present in the Unknown Passage, as portion of the tunnel was destroyed, Whitespace forms - the cubes - filled it in order for knight to pass over the gap.

White Clockwork tunnels are seen only once outside of the Core - in the [Divine theme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Theme_(Guild_Hall)) of the Guild Hall. It is the last and most expensive upgrade, requiring most of the wings of the Hall being unlocked and active. This connection establishes a relation between Divine color scheme due to the naming convention and nature of Whitespace. For the most part, divine-themed equipment is related to heavenly kingdom. But the difference here arises from the particular colors, as monochrome of Whitespace is not attributed to the divine color scheme. A more fitting connection through monochromatic pattern is attributed to the [Grey Prise Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Prize_Box).

Grey prize box contains replicas of every accessory, but also battle sprites. This pattern is similar to the white Clockworks in the Core, with an addition of darkened [grey aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Aura#Grey_Aura). We have the explanation behind this design, but it requires understanding role of the Swarm first, which will be discussed soon.

One more element of the grey prize box in particular is the [silver personal color](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Personal_Color#Silver_Personal_Color), as silver is the heavenly metal within this cosmology - as [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver), and the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), relating back to the celestials, supposed Owlites. A less important note is the pure grey design of non-prismatic elements of [Heavenly iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) which is transmuted with the introduction of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore).

The third design concept found in Whitespace is of square spiral. As in case of the [first introduction](#concept-of-spiral) of this form, we are searching for patterns:

- Walkways of the Step Beyond depths have transitory square spiral patterns.
- Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.

    The prior, notably, has image of an eye with significantly larger iris and pinkish purple color, reminiscent of curse more than Swarm's pink.
- Square spiral pattern is also observed across [Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact). It will be the point of the further analysis.

There are 3 main elements to the console itself: the display, a platform, and a slot for the Artifact.

The notable element of the console, which, we believe, is a solid proof of Console's gremlin origin, is the design of the console below the display. It is a curved structure of metal with internal components of dark metal and external plating of more bright color. And exactly on the latter, on each side of the console, there are 3-stub ends placed in a radial shape with a circled hole below. It is the exact design of the Clowkwork elevators - each side of which contains that exact design up to the inner and outer plating. Except for the color of the outer plating is more contrast. There are brass component sof the grid floor of the console, which hold the wires. Color of those elements is the same as the component of the same design around the moving Clockwork elevators' platform.

Ironwork-like designs on the outer and inner circles of the console's platform surrounding the grid and the pattern the Artifact's lid are similar to the Greek key - a part of the meander pattern. As both contain spiral or spiral-like patterns of right angles used as decorative component of the architecture, Greek architecture.

The meaning of this meander patter is usually accepted as movement of water or cyclical and moving nature of life. It also has associations with labyrinths or mazes. The labyrinth has
symbolic associations of fertility, birth, and death.

Due to utmost proximity of this Clockwork design to the Whitespace, we can gather that this design has greater importance to gremlin civilization, or at least, its inner party, such as Crimson Order, as nowhere else any symbolic element is present apart of Crimson Order insignia itself or the gremlin emblem.

The last components of the console are the display itself and slot for the artifact. While there is not much, currently, in regards to the slot Artifact is placed in, the display as wel las the Artifact's lid contain symbols, which we identify as gremlin written language.

##### Gremlin Conlang

Based on the encountered instances of gremlin written language, or rather their written system, we will use for the description of those symbol w in this document [unicode block symbols](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode/blocks/block-elements/). Those symbol are encountered in 3 instances - Console with the Artifact, and Roarmulus Twins.

The important thing is to establish is how to transcribe them, - does the dark element of the square fill the letter, or it is the white form we are looking for? To solve this, e have to look at physical letters. One such instance is on the side of the lid, covering the Artifact during activation - those symbols, judging by the lightning, are located in front of the darker elements. We consider this as the guide.

Then there is the direction in which those symbols are read. As console screen depicts rows as, likely, notations to the pulse flow from left to right, we can guess that the gremlin conlang is written horizontally from left to right. But the instance of the console screen does not tell of what are the symbols there - as we can consider the white squared as background, or as part of letters. To solve it, we appeal to the earlier case of symbols on the inner plate layer of the lid of the Artifact clot container, as there, there would be no need to carve with such intricacy the individual blocks.

- This, we believe, leads us to interpret the white background as if the color is inverted, meaning that the patter of the symbol is black.
- The same logic is then applied to the row of 3 symbol on the container's lid - reading there only black patterns.
- On the other inner metal plate on the horizontal dimension of the lid we look for white pattern on black background.
- The Roarmulus Twins' symbols are the black patterns

As a result, we get the following symbols:

- Console
  - console screen
    - Leftmost section
      - `▝` `▄` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▄` `▘` `▟`
      - `▞` `▗` `▌` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▟` `▝` `▗` `▝`
      - `▀` `▄` `▘` - a pulse line extends from this row
    - Pulse line annotations
      - `▝` `▚` `█` `_` `▛`
      - `▘` `▟` `▘` `▄` `▌`
      - `█` `▗` `▀` `▙` `▝` - positioned above rightmost pulse line
    - Rightmost section
      - `▗` `▀` `▄`
      - `▖` `▟` `▌`
      - `▐` `▞` `█`
  - Artifact Container Lid
    - `▗` `▀` `▙` - side of the lid, engraved on the outer metal plate layer
    - `█` `_` `▛` `▗` `▀` - Side of the lid is mirrored on both sides retaining its orientation. This means, that one of the readings - a side upon which it is read, is incorrect. Since the previous line is not symmetrically places, we will consider this orientation as correct.
    - The last text is on top of the lid, and it is as large as the console screen text. In fact, it is the same image, all of the lines from the console screen are appended to the leftmost block's last line.
- Artifact

    All of its 3 circles have the same pattern. We will looks for the black symbols on light background.

    `x` - marks lack of circle's surface

    `_` - marks lack of light on the surface

    The result is: `x` `▀` `x` `▐` `▞` `█` `▗` `x` `x` `▟` `x` `▖` `_` `▌` `▄` `x`
- Roarmulus Twins
  - Marking pointing to the right eye and the foundation with an arrow: `▀`

    Due to lack of space above the block, we can conclude that is only symbol possible to fit. And, due to to presence of a next line on the armor plate, we will read it in the same direction.
  - Arrows pointing to armor plates' joints: `_` `▀` `▟` `█` `▌` `▌`

    There are several issues with this transcription:

    - The last 2 repeating symbol is an uncommon pattern.
    - We can gather, that the `█` is incorrect, which will lead th followed symbols to be interpreted incorrectly. There is a possibility of `▐` being present.
    - But the one to last symbol has vertical side with a pit, followed to the left exactly as the width of `▌`, leaving the questionable symbol on the left as one similar to triangle. No such symbol is seen anywhere else.
    - The last symbol, due to lack of boxes, could be as `▌` as `▌`. So, due to this, we have to operate on those symbol with a possibility of error inherited in the transcription.

    This line is found in multiple instances, always pointing to a point of 2 plates connecting, which might five a hint to its meaning.

  Notably, the texture of the Roarmulus Bluprints has all metal notches depicted as on the Twins themselves.

Based on this, we can arrange a table of repetitions of each symbol:

| Symbol | Amount of times encountered |
|:------:|:---------------------------:|
|`▖`| 2 |
|`▗`| 7 |
|`▘`| 4 |
|`▝`| 5 |
|`▌`| 4 / 5? |
|`▐`| 2 |
|`▄`| 6 |
|`▀`| 6 |
|`█`| 5 / 6? |
|`▙`| 2 |
|`▟`| 4 |
|`▚`| 1 |
|`▞`| 3 |
|`▜`| x |
|`▛`| 2 |
|`_` (space or an empty outlined square)| 3 / 4? |

Mention of gremlin cryptography in the Aftermath (npc: `` - []()) may be related to this language. But the presented instances of the language, we believe, are now encrypted, as in case of Roarmulus twins, they served as markings on the joint of armor plates, and in case of Mysterious Console and Artifact, they seem to be instructions, as they are present both on top of the lid and in the holographic display, serving functional purpose, especially in the context of anything relation to the Core, or its hatch at depth 29.

There are also gremlin schematics, recovered from Crimson Order Complex 357 by Herex prior to his departure to the Throne Room of Firestorm Citadel. The schematics in that regard could relate to anything within the Core or simply to constructs. Our concern is of the nature of those schematics. There were ancient tomes present in the very end of the complex 357, and, considering prior analysis of gremlin technology, it could be anything related to Owlites, as far as tomes' design goes and their usage of elementals for the operation of Clockworks.

There are also instances of gremlin language, most of the time it is transcribed fluently, but in one instance - [Operation Greenhorn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn). In the strangers' town, gremlins have a different pattern of speaking: `Greetings, little. One. Don't step. On snipes.`, `Greetings. Get Shinies. Get Shinies.`, `Snipes. Buy? Sell?` (npc: [Strangers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn)).

As far as we have researched, we are unable to decipher the written form of the language. That is if it is an instance of a completed language. And, considering that most of this symbols would not be looked at, it is likely an unfinished form.

##### Artifact, Console, and a Hatch

Consoles contain the designs and patterns of square spiral or a Greek key, found within the Whitespace of the Core on the gates and across tile arrangements of the depths.

It is believed that combination of the Artifact and console is capable of opening the Core, but, we found several inconsistencies. The terms generator and Artifact will be used interchangeably.

[Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact) can contain some amount of energy, as evident by Herex and Razwog dialogue, as Razwog was tasked to find a way to power the Generator: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know.` [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven) and `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion.` (npc: [Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)).

The generator is located in the Power Complex-[like](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-The_Ancient_Generator-Restoring_Power.png) facility, with wires [going up into the platform with the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:TheArtifact-FirstSight.png). Notably, both wires of the activated console and wires found all across Cradle have the same animation of being powered, as pulse of light travels across them. This design is similar to the pulse lines found in the holographic screen of an active console. It is there both Cradle, its Moon, and Cradle's gimbal ring. We will return to the gimbal ring later. Active console's pulse is much higher. The intense light of an Artifact placed into the slot and connected to the console is similar to the light of the Core's shell plate seals, although lacking steam. Below the active console bolts of lightning are seem - that is another connection between role of Power Complexes and Clockworks.

Then there is a quote regarding this power complex: `Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp. It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. We need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface.` (npc: [Rescue Camp - Greta](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greta_Dialogue/Rescue_Camp)). Greta concludes that through Razwog's facility generator should not be interfered. Yet, it is unknown weather generator was found there or was placed in order to be powered by the facility: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know.` (npc: [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). Moreover, it is stated that its power is being diverted, rerouted. To where it is rerouted, remains known. The only lead here is the quote from Feron: `The name's Feron, Lieutenant of the Spiral Order. We had believed this entire complex was derelict until the elevator leading to it suddenly surged to life. Upon investigating the whole place soon went up in a blaze!` (npc: [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)), which might suggest, that the facility was inactive, and as it is located near the Razwog's complex, so the fact it was restored, could've been due to actions of knights restoring power in the Rescue Camp, or due to prolonged operation of Razwog's facility. In both instances, it seems that the generator was already powered by the time Greta had scanned the area.

The other matter is of the fact that Herex warned off Razwog: `The Order must never know we have the artifact.` (npc: [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). This suggests, that:

- Artifact was not intended to be found or recovered. The prior would suggest the Artifact was located below the camp and was power the surface in order to be concealed for any other location at the surface of Cradle. The fact that power was diverted of it, could mean that it was used for a different purpose. And, if it was stollen from a different location, this would have mean that the Order in question should have known of it.
- The Order - Crimson Order, as it is the only known entity - is related to the Artifact and aware of it. The seemingly un-powered state of the Artifact is then to be desired, as it is implied to be not powered.

  This idea of Herex going against Crimson Order was explored in a few other instances:

  - `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared.` (npc: [Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout))
  - `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other.` (npc: [Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357))

  From this, we can gather, that the intention to open the Core is one prohibited by Crimson Order.

Alpha Squad was sent into the Clockworks right after the crash landing, and most of te missions did follow the trey, they left behind in the form of Recon Modules. In the Core the last recon module is found: `We are at the end of the line. ...  And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light.` (npc: [Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

The other time core was reported to open was during [A Call to Arms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms): `This is Vaelyn at the Core Terminal. Team wiped out. Darkness everywhere. Send help. It is opening.` (npc: [A Call to Arms - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms#Dialogue)).

Both cases of Core opening can be eventually explained. The reanimation of the Citadel is halted seemingly due to activation of the console. yet, it is activated only by the time knight reaches the throne room. Then, there is a call from Vaelyn and only after it event of Dream and Nightmares unfold, wherein Vaelyn reinstates, that the core is opening. This can be interpreted in 2 ways: either the core opens particularly slowly, or it is a way to hammer in the point of Core opening. While the latter explanation supersedes any internal world logic, the prior does not, and, moreover can last far longer. By that we mean a possibility of knight first reaching the surface, and only then receiving an emergency call from Vaelyn.

It is also unknown, what were the contents of the previous report, which was blocked: `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it. ... We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical.` (npc: [The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)). But, as it is was stated, that Spiral HQ was in the middle of receiving a report, which can be interpreted as a comlink was already established and it was a regular report, or, it was blocked prior to being received. Then, the disruption was sudden, and unexpected. It is here we are unaware of how much time has passed since Lord Vanaduke was slayed, as up to that point most of the cavern within which Firestorm Citadel is located, was extinguished. We can gather that right after Vanaduke was defeated, Vaelyn started her expedition: `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.` (npc: [Honor and Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty)), and by the next mission a contact with the Core Terminal was established: `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts.` (npc: [The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues)).

Based of Herex's activity, we can gather that he and his supposed "inner fold" (npc: `All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears.` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)) moved into the Citadel once it became safe traverse. We considered inner group mainly due to presence of gremlins in the Throne Room of Shadowplay with Herex. Here, real-time insertion of the Artifact into the console could be a hyperbolic gesture to emphasize the stakes at certain moment. Yet, we propose, this would not disregard the fact that the Core was opening particularly slowly.

We could have unlinked this activity within the console to Core opening, but, due to how narrative is posed, it is the most likely connection.

Then there is an instance of the first time Core had opened, which was witnessed by the Alpha Squad. This is the point of inconsistency:

- `... we've located an energy signature similar to the one emanating from that Artifact you found in the Clockworks. We're homing in on that energy signature now. Finding the source might help us understand what that gremlin schemer Razwog planned on doing with the Artifact or what the device is actually capable of.` (npc: [A New Threat - Lobby - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby))

    Dialogue happens while the Artifact is in the Lab.
- `... most of our sensor equipment seems to have been damaged. It might take some time to get things working to the point where I can track down the Artifact.` (npc: [A New Threat - The Lab - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/The_Lab)).

    Dialogue happens after the Artifact was stollen.
- `I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature. Here is the bad news: the energy source has been pinpointed to a highly dangerous area of the Clockworks that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.' ... The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate. Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective.` (npc: [Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace))

    Dialogue happens some time prior to invading Royal Jelly Palace.

The original location of the energy signature could not have been Royal Jelly Palace, as it would require Herex to introduce the Artifact before it was captured in the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator). The Artifact had to be placed into the console either after it was stollen, as the signature seem to appear only on console's activation: `It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it.` (npc: [The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)). Moreover, if the disruption appears only on console's activation, then Vaelyn's message prior to [The Flickering Flame](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame) was that emergency of Core opening.

The only solution for such chain of events with the retention of the connection of Core opening with the activation of a console is that the Artifact was used on the Royal Jelly Palace console before it was returned to Razwog, which would require either Alpha Squad to descend at rapid speed to depth 29, or that the time passing between initial crash landing, Alpha Squad departure, and the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator) had to be much larger. The latter case is more plausible for the Alpha Squad recon modules' contents are made not in a short period of time:

- `As Spiral HQ is not yet fully operational and most systems are offline, these personal recordings will have to suffice as a record of our expedition until HQ can establish an Uplink system with squads in the field.` (npc: [Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module))

    It relates to a time prior to Knights even reaching Haven: `We discovered a town known as 'Haven' and have set up a base of operations there. The locals have provided us with food, shelter and power. It's not Isora, but it's home for now. I've pinpointed your location. Unfortunately you'll need to cross a massive chasm in order to reach Haven. Perhaps now that your camp has power there is an elevator somewhere leading into the Clockworks. You may just be able to reach us that way.` (npc: [First Contact - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/First_Contact))
- `We narrowly evaded a gremlin trap today. Ambushed on a platform above a pit of molten slag, we had to hold our ground against a horde of the snarling beasts as we dodged incoming rocket fire from above. Fun stuff. Grantz took the full blast of a rocket twice, reacting only with a stagger as if he had discovered a stone in his boot. Sometimes I think that beneath his iron suit is a body of equally heavy iron. It wouldn't surprise me. Parma has been hard on herself, saying that she should have scouted the trap. But how can you scout a world that is ever in flux? How can you be sure that the path ahead is still safe if you can never be sure it's still even there?` (npc: [Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module))
- `Within the Clockworks we can afford little sleep. Hostiles are around every corner and many of the environments are unsuitable for camp. But when sleep comes, I find myself dreaming more than I ever have before. In my dreams I see Cradle, slowly turning and drifting through the stars. I see the patches of its varying terrain unfold and stretch across the stars like an enormous quilt. It is an oddly comforting dream, to see a world unravel itself... But then I wake, and the chaos of the Clockworks engulfs me once more; the groans of its ever-turning cogs and howls of the terrible beasts that call it home echoing everywhere. I hope to return one day to the surface, to a sun, to a place where peace is more than a fleeting dream.` (npc: [Recon Module: The Gauntlet - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module))

Most of the entries directly refer to a fact that the expedition had lasted for multiple days. In order to keep the chronology of the events, we can suggest that the latter scenario of earlier missions lasting for a longer period of time is more plausible here. Unless, of course, there exists a possibility of the signature within the Royal Jelly Palace being a new signal. And as for the Shdowplay itself, as 2 missions relating to Vaelyn and her expedition to the Core: `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.` (npc: [Honor and Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty)), `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts.` (npc: [The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues)), we can further suggest, that some time had to pass between missions, even with the consideration of implied Clockwork elevators' speed.

Considering that during the event of Shadowplay Artifact remains in the console, suggests that it was not intended to be taken out just yet, but was either forcefully extracted, or the console had malfunctioned, which could be a possibility considering potential Clockworks' age. But, it seems conclusive, that the moment console was activated, a captured energy signal at Royal Jelly Palace's console, was the cause for Core's hatch to open temporarily the exact moment Alpha Squad had reached the Core Terminal after passing through the Firestorm Citadel. And, as Parma had stated to be followed by the Swarm prior to Core opening, we can further suggest, that the process of opening is slower that immediate (npc: `We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice. And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light.` - [Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

Introduction of the Artifact to the Console, paired with Herex's dialogue (npc: `I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion.` - [Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)) suggests, that it is the reason for Core's hatch opening, but, in order to work - to open the Core, - each time Artifact had to be recharged, it was already charged during the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator) covered earlier.

Keeping those effect in mind, we can hypothesize on presence of the Swarm during both instances of Core opening, before it had to actually open, as described by Parma, and seen during the events of [The Path is Revealed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed). This, again, ties with a undefined duration of the entire process of Core opening, starting from the Artifact being placed into the console.

The idea of activated console preventing subduing of the curse within the Firestorm Citadel (desc: `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance.` - [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)), we can propose, that the underling nature of energies cycling through the console, the comlink signal, and the fiery power of curse are all related.

#### Core Terminal

Here, we should also note of the design of the Core Terminal. Based on the designs of Grand Arsenal, briefing room at Aftermath specifically, we can conclude that the monitors are also of gremlin invention, as rest of Clockworks. But, compared to all known location, and especially other Clockwok Terminals starting from the Arcade itself, it is comprised of a single platform with to walls and a walkway to the Core's hatch, while peculiar amount of monitors is irregularly stacked across the platform.

Moreover, they are shown to depict only 2 states on their screens, of a lock, and and evil eye, this time attributed to the Swarm.

We can suggest, that such placement is intentional and designed to introduce an organic aspect of Clockworks, as suggested by Vaelyn:

- `I am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks. You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine.` (npc: [Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn)).
- `Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. It's not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite. ... I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, something terrible. I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.` (desc: [The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues))
- `The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it. I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong. ... I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. Think about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor. Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen. An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.` (npc: [Becoming a Champion - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Becoming_a_Champion))
- `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think it's like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow.` (npc: [Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module))

From here, we can finally begin to analyze the Swarm. First we have to return to the monitors. In the state, when the Core is Sealed, imagery of locks is blue with a 2-color blue pattern similar to gate icons behind the static. During the event of [The Path is Revealed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed), the static overtakes the background, rendering it black, while depicting the evil eye. From here on out, we will consider appearances of the Swarm as diegetic. This alone demonstrates, that Swarm is capable of interacting with gremlin, and potentially any, technology, making itself present and aware of through this medium.

#### Shadow Lairs

Shadow Lairs are introduced in a manner (desc: [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), which suggest, that the entities in question are alive and Spiral Order possess knowledge on them as if their were already defeated in the past:

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and it's king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`
- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`
- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!`

Here we will cover the rest of the locations, specifically the Wildwoods and the Citadel, and then analyze, weather they fit into an existing timeline.

##### Miasma

The miasma is described as the reason for the change within the Wildwoods: `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

yet, when Snarbolax is encountered, apart from being rabid, it is present in multiple instances. We have previously suggested, that Snarbolax is cursed, with curse accumulating in its hide, and gaining immortality, which would be the reason for its existence since the collapse of tortomega civilization.

Snarbolax was defeated by knights, unless here it was not one of its kind, as suggested by presence of multiple it instances.

This case of Rotting Metropolis creates a fitting precedent for existence of poisoned Gloaming Wildwoods and Radid Snarbolax. It is stated that `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!` (desc: [Release Notes: 2011.10.09](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), so, considering that all of Clockwork location can be moved, the prime example being molten cavern of Firestorm Citadel - `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. ... We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly.` (desc: [Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)), it is plausible for the wildwood at some point being affected by the [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) at depth 22.

As it was discussed earlier, we had proposed an existence of a [Vile Deity](), who is the reason behind supernatural occurrences related to poison, rot, and undeath across graveyards.

It is then a question weather it in fact exists and what is its influence onto material realm. And one argument that seems feasible is the existence of [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence): `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease.` as it is a material from the same tier and design as [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost) and [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul). We won't suggest, that a type of supernatural plague was utilized to create toxigels. But, a Underworld-originating plague, we suggest, is present in the Shadow Lairs version of Gloaming Wildwoods.

The reason to this consolidated in the effects of the miasma:

- Enemies affected by the miasma inflict poison.
- Snarbolax, in his shadowy form, gains poisonous properties as well as the design.
- The wildwoods are covered with a red mist.

The red mist is the main point of concern and a counter argument for Slime Generators being responsible for the creation of the miasma. So far, a few potential leads can be connected to this phenomenon:

- Red mist is similar to the glow of the vengeful shadow cloak of Maskeraith. Although the design differs, as the cloak has yellow lightning bolts within it, the mist does not.
- The context of the word Miasma across mythology is usually considered as a divine punishment and illness. The illness is present in the woods, but the punishment aspect remains unknown.

    We can attempt to link it to the fall of tortomega, through association with rage.

- The stone lantern found across the woods are similar to the stone lanterns of east Asia.

Apart from those leads, nature of red mist remains unknown.

##### True Citadel of Almirian Empire

<!-- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!` -->

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is in much regard far more dangerous than the regular counterpart. The presence of Nature Sprites and Darkfire Vanaduke, the lack of the console create unique conditions in order for it to exist within the canon. This is similar to the unknown chronology of Ice Royal Jelly Palace within the timeline.

To analyze nature of this variant of the Citadel, we have to start by isolating history and design of the general Firestorm Citadel.

It is known that it was the Grand Citadel of Almire (desc: `From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. ... Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him.` - [Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice.` (npc: [King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge))). Kingdom of Almire was located near the mountains, ones which held an altar to a fiery deity, which we concluded to be Vog, an Underworld deity. Almire's nature-themed designs, as well as a strong connection to Spirit Mother, which wos the reason for her intervention, resulting in capture of several Nature Sprites in the citadel itself by the time Lord Vanaduke had returned transformed.

At some point, it was captured by the Core, yet with its legions and cities seemingly intact.

Starting from thar point, Firestorm Citadel had resurfaced by the time Spiral Order got closer to the Core:

- `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news.` (desc: [Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire))
- `That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!` (npc: [Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle))

Large number of followed up missions were concerned with getting in proximity of the Citadel:

- `We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly.` (npc: [Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire))
- `An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor. A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. If what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep. Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters.` (desc: [An Occurrence at Owlite Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep))

  It directly connects Scarlet Fortress, [The Hall of Remembrance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep), to the [The Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Library.png) of Owlite Academy, as it is located in the Candlestick Keep.

- `The Spookats of Moorcroft Manor have another valuable piece of intel for us that is worth investigating. They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel. This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core.` (desc: [Alone in the Dark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alone_in_the_Dark))

  It contain both remains of Owlite Academy, the Candlestick Keep, and cooling chambers of Clockwork tunnels.
- [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet) itself is accessed through the Owlite Academy, transitioning, again, into the Scarlet Fortress. This time, notably, it contains most of the hazards, attributed also to gremlins - the freeze traps of cooling chambers. This was covered in the [gremlin containments section](). And here, we see more relation to the heavenly kingdom, as if it was surrounding the citadel.

Here we have to return to the topic of the [Forgotten Time](), as there we have discussed the possibility of Almire existing on the same planet as heavenly kingdom. Here, this positioning does raise suspicion, as geographically, through mythological inspirations, heavenly kingdom had to be located above the land of Ironmight Kingdom, tortomega ruins including Wildwoods and Aurora Isles, and Almire. At that point, as the planet had to be harvested, Aurora Isles would have to eventually end up being captured, but this would not explain the fact they, too, float. Unless the same technology used to hold up all of matter in skydomes, and elements of the Artifact and Console is applied.

We have mentioned that Carnavons and Slag Zombies have similar design and are only ones with explicit armor. One thing in particular is the following - if Carnavons are canon, their curse affliction is canon, would this make Shadow Firestorm Citadel canon? And if so, how would it fit with the existing one, apart from, for example, Shadow Lairs being a dream, unreal? Phsyically all of those location reach the shadow lairs proper - the unknown passage, - as only boss depths contain the first signs of the Swarm.

Another note on the canon of shadow lairs is the response to threat of the Swarm. There is no reaction on the result of an expedition into those. Event of [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw) demonstrate the threat of the Swarm without a follow-up. But, it demonstrates a possibility of shadow lairs rising into lower depth, as shown by the last depth of [A Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage), which is the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage). As in the boss depths of shadow lairs, a depth preceding unknown passage is, in the very end, influenced by the Swarm.

Here we propose a solution, one which, we believe, organically solves several loose ends.

Owlites, as the heavenly kingdom above the mountains, had witnessed the events of 3 kingdoms, Ironmight and Almire. Then Lord Vanaduke has returned from the mountains with the Legiion of Ur - of Isorian Wrdens transformed to trojans. Then, as the Legion has returned into the mountains - the Underworld, and the new undead kingdom of Almire became the Almirian Empire. Vanaduke began the invasion into the heavenly kingdom with his undead army of legions of Almire. Due to this, greater developments in the understanding of curse had emerged, - it is during that, more early time closer to Almire's Fall and Almirian Empire, rather than one suggested in the beginning of [Kat Tribe chapter](). The understanding of curse allowed for existence of all described there items, including the Divine Avenger with the property of curse being inverted. And it was the weapon to defend against undead legions of Almire.

Through this logic, we finally reach the dread seal ond ones who bear it. Dread Seal is acquired from the [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box), meaning, that it is associated with Owlites to a degree. In the accompanied [news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/News/2014), dread seal is placed on the Black Kat Mask, but more importantly, it is in a set with Chaos Cloak. Weather or not this design choice is canon, the fact that evil eye makes itself present on Owlite's Chaos Clok may serve as a link to other Owlite researches regarding nature of curse, as discussed in the beginning of [Kat Tribe chapter]().

As the Chaos Cloak is forbidden, the dread seal places with it seem to suggest it being a mark of danger, or a restriction, as discussed in hte [analysis of curse](). Seal's design is similar to the Fu talisman in Taoism, as it is placed by priest on ghost's forehead in order to hinder it. With the prior knowledge of Black Kats and Almire, we suggest the seal is created by Owlites. This would coincide with their last actions of Warding Candles being placed, as another measure to defend against Underworld.

In relation to Almire, the seal is placed of Carnavons. The only time this would chronologically fit is if Owlites did fought with Almirian Empire, the one after Lord Vanaduke's return.

Dark Embers, while are acquired for Almirian Seal tokens, are said to be `... salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time.` (desc: [Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), which would only be thematically fitting - through color purple - if the entire Citadal was of that theme.

It was previously discussed that Vog's fiery curse, the reason for Vog Cubs existence, is the other curse related to more fire of natural color. Through this logic we followed to the idea of darkfire being a distinct phenomenon in the [nature of darkfire section](#nature-of-darkfire). There we selected 2 interpretation of darkfire - regular by now, - variation of the curse, and a distinct creation emerging from Vog's curse being overtaken by the Underworld's curse. Darkfire would not have a reason to exist in the throne room of regular fire.

It was stated that army within the citadel was transformed - that would eventually mean that all Slag Walkers had turned into Carnavons. Yet both are present across Clockworks outside of Shadow Lairs. Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats, which are themselves summoned by the Dark ritual which can pull banished entities from the Underworld, such as trojans. The Seal is placed by Owlites of valkyries on the cursed entities.

Then there are differences between Firestorm, Shadow Firestorm Citadel, and "Greenstone" Citadel of Shadowplay.

Designs of Greenstone Citadel and Firestorm Citadel are essentially the same. This follows with the idea of Shadow Lairs not being canon. The Overgrown Court has a part of Ashen Armory fallen to its level, which coincides with the general structure of Greenstone Citadel's less stable state, as it crumbles.

There are notable elements within the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

- Much larger in quantity presence of metal chains. Chains themselves are much larger, going above and out of the view.
- More ramping arches present across the buildings surrounding the main area of depths, a less notable architectural change.
- Presence of wooden watchtower as well as usage of their components as, seemingly, reinforcements for the brickwork structure of the buildings.
- Almirian tapestry in several instances across the Shadow Firestorm Citadel is much larger in scale, as chains.
- All fire bowls have their yellow fire replaced with purple, which we proposed to be dark embers, as the same design is present in relation to undead locations, which also was a contributor to nature of darkfire as a regular phenomenon out of Underworld.
- Grim totems are more deeply integrated into the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadels.

  In both regular and shadow citadel, presence of totems is questionable, apart from game design perspective as undead levels. Unless, those were introduced by devilites.

- Lord Vanaduke's design also differs.
  - The most notable element is presence of an intact purple cloak of Darkfire Vanaduke. Almire's crest shown on its back is most intact, compared to the torn, as [Almirian tapestries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads), cape of Firestorm Lord Vanaduke.
  - The clothes below Vanaduke's armor, as well as the cloak, have the same triangular pattern in the design of not sawn rags, but far more finely preserved. The cape also ends with the triangular shapes, similar to the valkyrian raiments.
  - The armor of Darkfire Vnauke has the similar thematic change. It has no visible bolts and more monolithic, especially the face plate and chest, while the characteristic chains had remained. Moreover the part of armor around the face has more symbolic elements, a circle of outwards extending spikes. Due to this, we suggest it being symbolic to a medieval torture device, iron maiden specifically.

So, someone had to apply a curse onto the Citadel, which influenced the resulted state the Citadel is found in the Shadow Lairs.

Previously we have proposed, that due to wording on the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, Carnavons could've been cursed Slag Walker explained by the continuity itself. Yet, then a question remains - why only Carnavons have a shield, apart from being harder to hit from game-design perspective? Then the presence of Almire-aligned undead, including the royal guard - they, too, had to be justified to be present only in the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

All of those elements make Shadow Firestorm Citadel far more authentic, compared to the Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs. Presence of Dark Embers following curse theme should be a reason for this variant being the true one, an yet, Greenstone Citadel has all of the initial designs of the Firestorm Citadel.

##### Causality

Generally, as state in the beginning of [this section](#shadow-lairs), all Shadow Lairs follow a different continuity and chronology, almost a different timeline. Across all of the story at most surface level, and the over-analysis such as this, no manipulation to time were found. So, a different case presents itself - of a different canon, a an alternative interpretation to already visited events. Such example was found with Lord Vanaduke's mask and finery furniture, based on a fact both of them could not exist simultaneously, if both of them are not canonically transmuted but found.

The entire depth of Shadow Lairs also contains the unknown Passage, which was established as more canon than its iteration in It Came From Below, as the latter instance had no justified reason to contain Whitespace blocks while not leading into the Whitespace. Apart from this design, the events of this mission were not acknowledge in any form until a direct encounter with the Swarm during Dreams and Nightmares.

Here we can compare depths of Shroud of Apocrea to the Shdow Lairs - a notable distinction is to be made here - Apocrean depths have a [background](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), which follows gate icon design pattern. Due to this, as well due to roster of Void enemies within the Unknown Passage, we can assume, that Swarm does modify what is intended to be seen on the gates, removing any distinction between nature of artificial, mechanical, and organic entities. With this assumption, the presence of Unknown Passage in the events of It Came From Below seems as if the Swarm itself was ascending from the Shadow Lairs. The influence it exceeds on surrounding depths is consistent across all encounters.

Based on the fact that slime generators were the reason behind knights unable to reach farther than depth 23, means that the terminal remained for a time the deepest point of exploration. So, this would mean that Shdow Lairs would not be accessible from any other location. Moreover, most of the locations preserve their structure, which, apart from game design efficiency reasons, would mean that those had fallen into the Shadow Lairs. This would fit chronologically, nearing the events of It Came From Below, as there Clockworks' behavior resulted in Swarm's presence outside of the Lairs, yet leading into the Unknown Passage, there named as Descend Into Darkness, rather than a name of physical location. Due to this we can attempt to fit events of Shadow Lairs right before the events of Shadowplay or after Dreams and Nightmares.

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

    As discussed earlier, Snarbolax had to be defeated, unless it is not one of its kind. This can be potentially resolved through the presence of [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarblepup). Based on earlier instances of battle sprites reaving on Cradle's past, this could be an explanation for Rabid Snarbolax's existence.

- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and it's king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`

    Could potentially mean that Ice Queen did arrive after the initial defeat of the Jelly King during [Sovereign Slime](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Sovereign_Slime).

    And, if the Queen supposedly herself usurped the throne, this would not fit into the current timeline.

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`

    The factory did contain multiple instances of Project R models, with 2 pods absent in the hangar. The first time Roarmulus Twins are mention is as follows: `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` (npc: [Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)). Due to this, we can gather that at least within the logic of moving those into Haven, multiple of their instances would be present.

    Possibility of a scenario wherein gremlins would have to improve upon the existing model, we suggest, exists only under the condition of the previous iteration - the regular Roarmulus Twins, - were defeated. So, this would fit to the existing timeline of events, compared to the previous 2 instances.

- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!`

  With all of context in mind, for the cohesiveness of the narrative, we propose a potential 2 scenarios of fitting Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Darkfire Vanaduke into the timeline:

  - Earlier we have mentioned, that a curse had to be applied externally, which resulted in transformation of the Citadel. Yet, it is stated, that Lord Vanaduke was not defeated, but transformed, suggesting that this Lair had to be traversed prior to the Events of [The King of Ashes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes).

      This scenario is possible if the canon version of the citadel which was traversed is the Shadow one. And, as this was debunked, we can suggest that the unseen during the events of Shadowplay floors were afflicted by curse, in order for Darkfire Vanaduke being the one to be defeated.

  - Shadow Firestorm citadel is the one Knighs had to traverse after the events of Dreams and Nightmares.

      How it would be possible, as it is during Shdowplay we discover the overgrown state of the Citadel? Here we would consider the connection to the activated console with the Artifact: `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power.` (desc: [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)), as the [Throne Room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room) remains in the same fiery environment, even with the remains of the supposed ceiling after Lord Vanaduke's initial fight during [The King of Ashes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes). As the Artifact had remained in the console, we can only suggest, that this was the reason for the reanimation of the Citadel.

      This would simultaneously explain presence of dark embers as a material in small quantity, and allow for the thematically fitting counterpart to be present. To explore this resolution, we have to look at the nature of the curse and parallels across the stories involving it.

      As tortodrones, reactivated by dark matter, as Margrel, summoned from the Underworld, Darkfire Vanaduke has more distinct presence of purple cracks across his armor. Paired with the idea of curse being applied to the citadel, we can gather, that this has to involve devilites, and Nefariom Imp at that. We can suggest so also due to reasoning of gremlins attempting to contain citadel's fires in the [suggested in gremlin containments section]().

      Due to this, Nature Sprites would be still present, but, absence of the console would not. Same applied for the Ice Queen, as her version of the Royal Jelly Palace also lacks the console. The only way to resolve this is to suggest that it was removed by actions of currently unknown actor, without leaning to a game direction and design reasons.

#### Alchemical Symbolism of Shadow Lairs: Great Work and Rebis

We propose, that Shadow Lairs as a separate expedition, contain a thematic element to them, found through their symbolic themes relating to alchemy, but also the Void: `I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)). We will suggest` an idea of this Void is one being related to the alchemical Void, until then we will mainly focus on the symbolism of Shadow Lairs' expeditions, as in regards to all things Swarm-related, any assumption can and likely will swing final conclusion into an area of speculation. So, due to this, we are not about to make distinct claims, but rather point out the symbolic elements.

The notion of a descend into the Shadow Lairs, through the unknown Passag, into the Sanctuary, and acquisition of a rare material, unique to the lair is, we believe, is an alchemical metaphor for the process of creation of the Great Work, and of a particular kind. By that we mean, as the phenomenon of alchemy as of pseudo-chemistry is rooted from a projection of inner consciousness onto a physical world, its elements also become symbolic. The theme is concealed in the alchemical process itself, and its final goal, here described from the english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy":

```md
In the hero myth this state is known as being
swallowed up in the belly of the whale or dragon. The heat
there is usually so intense that the hero loses his hair, i.e., he is reborn
bald as a babe. This heat is the ignis gehennalis, the hell into
which Christ descended in order to conquer death as part of his opus.
The philosopher makes the journey to hell as a “redeemer.” The
“hidden fire” forms the inner antithesis to the cold wetness of the sea.

...

The “treasure hard to attain,” whose presence was suspected in the
dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways.
Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia)
is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by
the “celestial and glowing spirit,” must transform this natural work of art
—chaos—into the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life-
giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is
potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements
rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that “our
heaven” may come into reality (ad actum).
Johannes Grasseus quotes the view that the prima materia is the lead
(plumbum) of the philosophers, also called the “lead of the air” (an
allusion to the inner opposite). This lead contains the radiant white dove,
called the “salt of the metals.” The dove is the “chaste, wise,
and rich Queen of Sheba, veiled in white, who was willing to give herself
to none but King Solomon.”

A similar idea is to be found in Michael Maier: The sun, by its
many millions of revolutions, spins the gold into the earth. Little by little
the sun has imprinted its image on the earth, and that image is the gold.
The sun is the image of God, the heart is the sun’s image in man, just as
gold is the sun’s image in the earth (also called Deus terrenus), and God
is known in the gold. This golden image of God is the anima aurea,
which, when breathed into common quicksilver, changes it into gold.

Ripley is of the opinion that the fire must be extracted from the chaos
and made visible. This fire is the Holy Ghost, who unites father and
son. He is often represented as a winged old man, i.e., Mercurius in
the form of the god of revelation, who is identical with Hermes
Trismegistus and, together with the King and the King’s Son, forms the
alchemical trinity. God wrought this fire in the bowels of
the earth, just as he wrought the purging flames of hell, and in this fire
God himself glows with divine love.

The examples given in the last chapter show that there is a spirit
hidden in the prima materia, just as there was in the Nile stone of
Ostanes. This spirit was eventually interpreted as the Holy Ghost in
accordance with the ancient tradition of the Nous swallowed up by the
darkness while in the embrace of Physis—with this difference, however,
that it is not the supreme feminine principle, earth, who is the devourer,
but Nous in the form of Mercurius or the tail-eating Uroboros.
In other words, the devourer is a sort of material earth-spirit, an
hermaphrodite possessing a masculine-spiritual and feminine-corporeal
aspect. The original Gnostic myth has
undergone a strange transformation: Nous and Physis are
indistinguishably one in the prima materia and have become a natura
abscondita.

The psychological equivalent of this theme is the projection of a
highly fascinating unconscious content which, like all such contents,
exhibits a numinous—“divine” or “sacred”—quality. Alchemy set itself
the task of acquiring this “treasure hard to attain” and of producing it in
visible form, as the physical gold or the panacea or the transforming
tincture—in so far as the art still busied itself in the laboratory. But since
the practical, chemical work was never quite free from the unconscious
contents of the operator which found expression in it, it was at the same
time a psychic activity which can best be compared with what we call
active imagination. This method enables us to get a grasp of contents
that also find expression in dream life. The process is in both cases an
irrigation of the conscious mind by the unconscious, and it is related so
closely to the world of alchemical ideas that we are probably justified in
assuming that alchemy deals with the same, or very similar, processes as
those involved in active imagination and in dreams, i.e., ultimately with
the process of individuation.

Earlier on, we left Arisleus and his companions, together with Beya
and the dead Thabritius, in the triple glass house where they had been
imprisoned by the Rex marinus. They suffer from the intense heat, like
the three whom Nebuchadnezzar cast into the fiery furnace.
King Nebuchadnezzar had a vision of a fourth, “like the Son of God,” as
we are told in Daniel 3 : 25. This vision is not without bearing on
alchemy, since there are numerous passages in the literature stating that
the stone is trinus et unus. It consists of the four
elements, with fire representing the spirit concealed in matter. This is the
fourth, absent and yet present, who always appears in the fiery agony of
the furnace and symbolizes the divine presence—succour and the
completion of the work.
```

And, through the four stages of alchemical process:

```md
Four stages are
distinguished, characterized by the original colours mentioned
in Heraclitus: melanosis (blackening), leukosis (whitening), xanthosis
(yellowing), and iosis (reddening). This division of the process into four
was called the, the quartering of the
philosophy. Later, about the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the colours
were reduced to three, and the xanthosis, otherwise called the citrinitas,
gradually fell into disuse or was but seldom mentioned. Instead, the
viriditas sometimes appears after the melanosis or nigredo in exceptional
cases, though it was never generally recognized. Whereas the original
tetrameria corresponded exactly to the quaternity of elements, it was now
frequently stressed that although there were four elements (earth, water,
fire, and air) and four qualities (hot, cold, dry, and moist), there were
only three colours: black, white, and red. Since the process never led to
the desired goal and since the individual parts of it were never carried out
in any standardized manner, the change in the classification of its stages
cannot be due to extraneous reasons but has more to do with the
symbolical significance of the quaternity and the trinity; in other words,
it is due to inner psychological reasons.

The nigredo or blackness is the initial state, either present
from the beginning as a quality of the prima materia, the chaos or massa
confusa, or else produced by the separation (solutio, separatio, divisio,
putrefactio) of the elements. If the separated condition is assumed at the
start, as sometimes happens, then a union of opposites is performed under
the likeness of a union of male and female (called the coniugium,
matrimonium, coniunctio, coitus), followed by the death of the product of
the union (mortificatio, calcinatio, putrefactio) and a corresponding
nigredo. From this the washing (ablutio, baptisma) either leads direct to
the whitening (albedo), or else the soul (anima) released at the “death” is
reunited with the dead body and brings about its resurrection, or again the
“many colours” (omnes colores), or “peacock’s tail” (cauda pavonis),
lead to the one white colour that contains all colours. At this point the
first main goal of the process is reached, namely the albedo, tinctura
alba, terra alba foliata, lapis albus, etc., highly prized by many
alchemists as if it were the ultimate goal. It is the silver or moon
condition, which still has to be raised to the sun condition. The albedo is,
so to speak, the daybreak, but not till the rubedo is it sunrise. The
transition to the rubedo is formed by the citrinitas, though this, as we
have said, was omitted later. The rubedo then follows direct from the
albedo as the result of raising the heat of the fire to its highest intensity.
The red and the white are King and Queen, who may also celebrate their
“chymical wedding” at this stage.

...

The prima
materia was thought of as an ever-changing substance, or else as the
essence or soul of that substance. It was designated with the name
“Mercurius,” and was conceived as a paradoxical double being called
monstrum, hermaphroditus, or rebis. The lapis-Christ
parallel establishes an analogy between the transforming substance and
Christ, in the Middle Ages doubtless under the influence of the
doctrine of transubstantiation, though in earlier times the Gnostic
tradition of older pagan ideas was the dominant factor. Mercurius is
likened to the serpent hung on the cross (John 3 : 14), to
mention only one of the numerous parallels.

The “Cantilena” ends with the apotheosis of the virgin-mother. This
the above-mentioned Pandora depicts as a glorification of Mary, the
assumptio Beatae Mariae Virginis. After her death, by a divine
miracle her body was again united with her soul and both together were
taken up to heaven. This has long been the view of the Church, although
it has only recently been promulgated as a dogma. [In fig. 232] she is
marked with the words “terra” and “corpus Lyb” (body) and “die wonn
der jung-frowenn wardt” (who became the joy of virgins); the dove
descends upon her, and God the Father touches her with his right hand in
benison. She is crowned. The figure of God holding the orb is inscribed
“Anima Seel” and “Jesse pater, filius et mater.” “Mater” refers to the
Queen of Heaven enthroned beside him, the King; for in her the earth
substance, becoming transfigured in her resurrected body, is absorbed
into the Godhead. On the left is a bearded figure equal in rank to God
the Father, inscribed “Sapientia Wyssheit.” In the shield below there is a
picture of the rebis being freed from the prima materia.

In the stone, as we know, the chaotic antagonism of the elements is
replaced by the most intense mutual alliance, which is what makes the
stone incorruptible, this being the reason why, in our author’s opinion, it
has the same effect as the blood of the Saviour: “sanitas atque vita
diuturna in foelicitate, propter quam praecipue lapis noster est petendus”
(health and long life in felicity, on account of which our stone is chiefly
to be sought).

Therefore Mercurius philosophorum is to be considered a spiritual
body, as the philosophers call him. From God the Father was born his
own Son Jesus Christ, who is God and man, and is without sin, and who
also had no need to die. But he died of his own free will, and rose again
for the sake of his brothers and sisters, that they might live with him
without sin for ever. So, too, is the gold without flaw, and is fixed, potent
to withstand all examinations, and glorious; yet, for the sake of its
imperfect and sick brothers and sisters, it dies and rises again, glorious
and redeemed, and tinctures them to eternal life, making them perfect
like to pure gold.

It is clear enough from this material what the ultimate aim of
alchemy really was: it was trying to produce a corpus subtile, a
transfigured and resurrected body, i.e., a body that was at the same time
spirit. In this it finds common ground with Chinese alchemy, as we
have learned from The Secret of the Golden Flower. There the main
concern is the “diamond body,” in other words, the attainment of
immortality through the transformation of the body. The diamond is an
excellent symbol because it is hard, fiery, and translucent. Orthelius
tells us that the philosophers have never found a better medicament than
that which they called the noble and blessed stone of the philosophers, on
account of its hardness, transparency, and rubeous hue.
```

Here we are to apply this concept on Shadow Lairs, we propose a following correspondence.

Isorians crash land on Cradle due to their search of an energy source, which is the Core. Paralelling to it an idea introduced by knights starting to feel as if they were intended to crash land:

-

Then there are the materials. We suggest an existence of a parallel in the materials acquired in the Sanctuary depending on the Shdow Lair, and stages of the Work. The three prior materials represent the alchemical stages - a metaphorical process of transformation of Prima Materia. This symbolism is depicted in the Nighmare Mane - being the blackening, Celestial Ore - the whitening, and then to Gremlonium - the reddening. [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium) - `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines`, seems to be a red powder, which is the same as powder of projection in 12-step process of Great Work.

Then, there is Maiden's Tear, it is a sacred jewel, and, we believe, in conjunction with the theme of fire due to traversal of the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, serves as the metaphorical crucible for the creation of the Great Work of Prime Matter, referring to Isorians, literally being forged - prepared, - to take on the Swarm. Firestom Citadel serves as the fire of `highest intensity`, from which Maiden's Tear, a sacred jewel, finally emerges. It is the representation of the reunion of 2 Isorian pasts - one of Isora, and one of Almire, - symbolized by the alchemical path of the Almirian Crusader set, as reunion of the known, or conscious, - Isora from where their thought-to-be-destined journey begins; and unknown, of the unconscious, of Almire.

In additional, while potentially misleading, component to this proposal is the arrangement of Red King and White Queen who through the metaphor of union create the divine Rebis. Within the cosmology of Spiral Knights there are such figures: the supposed genius king Tinkinzar, associated with the Crison Order, and Spirit Mother, which we propose to be a divine and benevolent entity, closely related to Almire, who can be consider as White - the White Queen, is the unity of both requiring to achieve an enlightened or complete state of being. But, this endeavour would fail manifested as the Swarm, - currently a speculation, but one we will provide substance throughout the following analysis of the Swarm.

#### The Swarm

Architect-Core-Cradle-Sleeper relation must be looked at through the lens of narrative analysis and themes, in conjunction with the events - arcs and themes, - preceding the Clockworks.

##### Location of a Breach into the Core

We will begin from the though, suggesting that the Swarm was within the Core this entire time, taken at face value:

- `The recon module you collected is very strange. I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say. Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. It's not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite.` (desc: [The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn))
- `If the Core isn't kept sealed The Swarm will escape and it will continue to consume everything and everyone.` (desc: [Dreams and Nightmares - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn))
- `Who could have guessed that this 'Swarm' was just waiting for someone to stumble across the Core and free it?` (desc: [Delved Too Deep - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora))
- `Such power! I never imagined...! ...and it will be unleashed. You! I will make you its first victims.` [Dreams and Nightmares - The Path is Revealed - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed)

But then a question arises - how the Swarm was able to feed on Core while sealed within, when it is directly encountered in the most active to date state within the Shadow Lairs? And, with an access elevator to Sanctuary from the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage)? Essentially, the question is - where is the Swarm coming from, from the inside of the Core or from the Shadow Lairs?

As Parma told, the Swarm breached the Core - `We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since.` (npc: [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)), leading to a conclusion of reachability of the power source under normal conditions of Core being sealed. If power source is located outside of the Core, the Swarm had no reason to breach it?

Depite the location, where the Swarm had originated, outside or within the Core, the breach should serve as a connection between the Core and the rest of the world. Here we propose a potential solution, to one which we will return to analyze in detail and how it applies to both cases of Swarm's location - the entrance to the Sanctuary in the end of the unknown Passage is the breach, Parma had spoken of.

As Unknown Passage ends, already in the most severe destroyed state of Clockwork tunnel within the skydome, the elevator to the Sanctuary is completely cut off. If the Sanctuary is located within the Core, which will assume for now, but wll also discuss, this elevator should by that logic go through the breach.

By that logic the Sanctuary is to be located within the Core.

The space beyond mechanical skydome of Clockworks design is pure white, nowhere else we find design as such outside of the Core's [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge).

If the skydome was outside of the Core, Spiral HQ surely would notice such tremendous amount of energy cycling through the Clockworks. Yet, it could be shaded by the Swarm, as in case of other locations residing in the Shadow Lairs, but, considering the theme of Whitespace and Refuge, we are confident that the Sanctuary is within the Core, as it is stated to be safe (npc: `YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` - [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)), is it has a limited capacity to repel the Swarm, as suggested by Parma: `The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since. ... The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker.` (npc: [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

Here we have to bring up previous idea of Shadow Firestom Citadel, as its unknown Passage leads to the Sanctuary, - this does not seem to thematically fit with the events of Dreams and Nightmares, as by that time the name of Swarm would be revealed.

Then it is the proposal of Sanctuary located outside of the Core. Spiral HQ has the technology to detect surges of energy and accompanied consoles' activation. But, they hadn't noticed anything apart from energy surges by activation of Consoles during and relatively prior to the main rank missions.

There is a question then - how HQ had not discovered Darkfire Firefstorm Citadel? It must be somewhere in the Shadow Lairs, but it seems that they would not if not for the proximity to the Core and Recon Knights: `But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it.` ([9-1: Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora)).
  
Sanctuary skydome can potentially be hidden within Cradle's volume but, as mentioned, it would be thematically incorrect for 2 identical location being located outside and inside the Core under the current cosmology. Yet, we have to discuss weather Unknown passage is located in the Core, and by extensions, Shadow Lair, as lon as their is vagueness, those possibilities should not be removed completely.

Whitespace design is nowhere present except the Core, as we explore them in [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares). [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge), despite having a Core elevator icon, has the same design of skydome as the Sanctuary and Whitespace blocks. The question is then: why the Sanctuary has a different elevator icon? For this we have to hold on to the idea of a Dream as a tangible concept, which refers to a physical space.

At current point, Swarm's location can be interpreted in 2 ways:

1. The Swarm is located within the Core. Then it breaching the Core means getting outside of the Core.

    It is visibly present on the outside as in the events of Shadow Lairs and It Came From Below's Into The Maw. As the depth's name of Descend into Darkness is used twice - in the context of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness) and of [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below#Gate_Map) preceded by [Into the Maw](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw). We won't discard the potential for Shadow Lair being in the Core.

    This part of the Swarm could be the one escaping from the Core through the breach - this Swarm feeds of the energy from outside of the Core as if it's internals do not provide it the means to persist. The distinction here is made between energy presence across power complexes and wires, and the Whitespace of the Core.

    Yet, it was stated that Swarm was mirroring itself within the Dream:

      `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

    We will keep this concept of a Dream and act of mirroring in mind. One thing is certain here, the only deific entity, related to themes of Whitespace is the Sleeper due to lack of any other contestants, as well as this entity being the only one referring to the Swarm only through interaction with the Sleeper:

      - `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))
      - `... he fell while protecting us from The Swarm. He stood his ground even when the rest of us were forced to flee. ... But then...then the light surrounded us and we were safe. We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since.` (npc: [Dreams and Nightmare - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge))
2. The Swarm is located in the Clockworks outside of the Core, within the stratum of Unknown Passage or the Shadow Lairs generally. Breaching the Core in that context means entering it from the outside, and feeding on energy within the Core, the Whitespace.

    As the event of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares) suggest, Swarm's concentration within the Core is seen in lesser amount, yet [growing by the depth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness), at least by fact of currently absent [Swarm Sources](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source).

##### Sleeper's Location, Sanctuary, and Refuge

The Sanctuary [Echo Stones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone) tell:

  `I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The punctuation is crucial here. A void opened not within the dream, but the Sleeper saw the void opening from his dreaming state.

Despite it, the Dream placement must be questioned - what and where is it? Is it the Core, metaphysical state, Cradle, or the Sanctuary skydome? The latter is of particular interest, as in the context of entering the Sanctuary for the first time, from the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods, which was initially the first unlocked Lair (desc: `Shadow Lairs are grouped into three ranks. All knights with Tier 3 clearance automatically gain Shadow Lair Clearance 1. Completing a Shadow Lair Rank 1 earns you clearance into the next rank and so on.` - [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), it is the Sanctuary which is referred to as a `fleeting dream`.

There're mentions of a Dream in other instances:

- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `BUT THIS DREAM IS FLEETING. USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace))
- `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

The Sleeper's `my dream` and `this dream` are places, potentially separated spatially, and possibly, temporally, as the Sleeper talks about the Swarm in the past tense - `I SAW`, `FELT`, `IT GREW`, but also in the present - `USE WHAT IS HERE`, `I SEE YOUR LEGION`. The structure of the sentence suggests, that the Sleeper is not sleeping during the event of the game, as only 2 Echo stones specifically say the Sleeper is dreaming, [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) and [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seem more like statements, more direct and urgent. This pattern seems intentional, as if the Sleeper was weakened by the time it awakened by the Swarm as it "breached" the Core, which is confirmed by Parma: `The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker.` (npc: [Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

In that interpretation, the `fleeting dream` is Sleeper's `my dream`, from which it seemingly awakens, or at least capable to communicate. It seems correct to assume that the place where Sleeper is - a proposal of it being the Sanctuary, as the most fortified against influence of the Swarm, - leads to an idea that Sleeper is in the Sanctuary. Yet, which only narrows the identity of a Dream. For that we have to look at a different word - the world.

##### The World

The World is mentioned several times across Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace))
- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)
- `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))
- `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))

Those quotes make seem like the word "world" refers both to Cradle and the "worlds" contained within the skydomes. But how they were drawn to shield the Sleeper, except through the rotation within the clockworks? Does this mean that Cradle itself as an entity separate from the Core?

This gives another clue to Sleeper's physical location, - within the Core - the Sanctuary specifically, or being the Core. The Core at the Core Terminal does not seem particularly large, seemingly capable of containing a single skydome. This raises the question of plausibility of Refuge and Sanctuary being different locations.

With the established physics of Whitespace, it is capable of manifesting matter - Whitesapce blocks, out of "nothing", - could it be that the volume of the Core is far larger than it is perceived on the outside? 

Notably, behavior of Whitespace is similar to the [Ghost Blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Block#Ghost_Block). Ghost Blocks have a light-blue glow of the Core and Artifact, while having a depiction of curse to the one on gremlin Collector's back. We don't currently know of its meaning apart from possessing a capacity to make matter disappear.

If, hypothetically, the Whitespace of the Core is infinite, how Sleeper could grow weaker within the infinite volume? It might be that the Sanctuare is finite, defined by its skydome, and it is within an infinite space of literal white space of the Core. Within this logic, the Whitespace would be only entity accompanied Sleeper and contained within the Core, meaning that it is the source of energy. The idea of infinite space of Whitespace can be suggested by the Echo Stone:

  `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

If this statement is taken literally, does that mean, that Whitespace is a different realm, or at least at its border, as skydome and regular matter clearly exists intact?

While the Dream is either the Core or Whitespace or the Sanctuary, option of skydome being the Sleeper's dream presents an opportunity for a World to be referring either to Cradle or Core's artificial shell and above, including Cradle. We know that the worlds referred to, are ones in skydomes, and the world in general implies Cradle, so this might in fact solidify a suggestion that the Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, the only safe place, as stated by itself as well as by lack of the Swarm in [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge) while being followed by it in [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness):

  `YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The phrasing `NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU` is similar to the following lines:

- `I lost sight of him as things went black. It felt like a thousand hands were pulling us away. As if something didn't want us to follow.` [Dreams and Nightmares - A Step Beyond - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn)
- `Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit.` [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge) - the scenario of ending up within the skydome of the Core is familiar to the Shadow Lairs leading to Sanctuary.

    Since the latter mission was before the Core opening, it is quite possible, the the Sleeper or the same Alpha Squad member, through the breach, arranged for the Knight to enter the Sanctuary. Sleeper there mentions through the Echo Stone: `YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

This wording makes it seem like the "arms" are reaching from the outside, and, considering that in both current scenarios knight escapes into the whitespace, it seems that the arms are outside of the Core. The only reason why arms would be present if they were preventing anyone entering the Core. Swarm, with its current goals (npc: `IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` - [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)), had no reason to prevent anyone, if it does not present a danger to it. This is an argument for Swarms location being in the Core in its fullest extent, but not the Shadow Lairs themselves, if we consider Unknown Passage being above the Core during [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw).

Parma mentions of exit: `I knew I'd never make it here in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit.` (npc: [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)). It suggests that the knight and Vaelyn were in danger, as evident by higher Swarm presence, as well as by the naming of the prior depth - [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness). Yet, we can not rely on depth identification - as evident by [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge) being at depth 28, above Core Terminal of depth 29. This and the multiple meaning of the Descend Into Darkness make it difficult to identify without relying on the subjective perception of themes.

##### The Dream

Now with that paradigm, we return to the question of the Dream - what it is, and then, where is the Swarm.

1. If the Dream is the white skydome of Sanctuary/Refuge, and the Swarm remains within the Core, seeping into the Clockworks, the Whitespace could be considered near Swarm's source as the Swarm can't reach the Sanctuary.

    But, we encounter a gameplay mechanic - the map. The map, compared to the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage), is not obscured within the Core, as well as we do not observe [Swarm Sources](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source) within the Whitespace of [A Step Beyond](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond).

    Swarm's concentration without Swarm Source reaches local high at [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness). There is a different question of: does this mean that the Swarm was sieging the Sancuray/Refuge skydome, where the Sleeper is supposedly located?
    this seems as plausible explanation, which would also explain weakness of Sleeper and a possibility of Swarm expanding infinite. Weather seemingly infinite energy output of the Core, consumed by the Swarm, would make Sleeper weaker, currently is unknown, as we are unaware of Whitespace's exact composition.

2. Dream is the Core with Whitespace, Swarm is external.

    In that case we have a scenario, where Swarm and the Sleeper exist in-place together within a single Dream, as the "this" Dream stated to be unreachable by the Swarm, while it breaches the Core from the Clockworks, and mirrors itself within its space - mirroring itself within the Whitespace.

    This approach may seem less straightforward, considering Vaelyn, Kora, and Parma's dialogues, suggesting that the Swarm is in the Core. So we can suggest a following option.

    The Core and the Cradle are referred to as the World and the 'my dream', as Sleeper slept through construction of Clockworks or a dream of protection. Namely `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER` means that it was not protected, until `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS ...` - protected by Cradle and it's worlds (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

    Cradle was created to protect Sleeper. Where Vealyn was right and [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) tell, it became a prison in a sense that the Sleeper was imprisoned at by Architect.

In that context, the Core being sealed is an act of imprisonment, but one suggested to be a short term solution, as due to presence of Swarm, now it is detrimental. Crimson Order at that seem to uphold this status quo by the fact of Herex's secrecy and his perception of them being the fault one.

The Core could not be built momentarily, as its physicality is of material realm. It would be part of protection originally build with the Cradle, but now the Core and the Cradle are a prison:

  `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))

The `IT` term in the [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) - `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. ... IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` - makes it seem that the Swarm was getting stronger inside the the space which is occupied by or is the same as the dream - `THE SPACE OF MY DREAM`. It is plausible if we think of the Dream being not the Sanctuary, but on the contrary, the Core with it's Whitespace contained - for example, a definition of a space under Sleeper's authority over matter. This idea ties to a the fact that Swarm was feeding on Core's energy, mirroring itself either within it - the Whitespace.

The term of mirroring if interpreted, would mean presence of mirrors in a confinement. Such confinement being the Whitesapce within the Core. Or, if Dream's space being Cradle, the mirrorings would be then the Shadow Lairs. But as Sleeper is weaker, and refers to the dream as Sancruary, we suggest that the Swarm's mirroring was also within the Core, as the endlessness of Whitespace and a concept of unlimited power source to feed upon.

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods)
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` (Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace)

Based on this we come to the following conclusions:

- The Sleeper is safe within the Sanctuary, his dream - a constructed skydome within Core's Whitespace, which initially was the totality of Whitespace, essentially being a volume of Sleeper's security.
- Whitespace itself is infinite and is the source of Energy. The space taken buy the Whitepace is surrounded by the Core to interact with it in controlled manner, as proven by presence of Consoles, with the Clockworks and to power them. Consoles are capable of opening Core's hatch when charged Artifact is inserted.
- The Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, as mentioned - constructed as a regular skydome of Clockworks for a reason, and an only place to contain grass and water, as well as exit from the Core.

From Core's sealed state, Sanctuary and entities within are capable of limited control over Core's operation, accessing Core internal space, as Parma managed to find an exit to the Refuge. An exit in that sense, from infinity of Whitespace, which as it got deeper, was the more occupied by the Swarm. Connection to the rest of Clockworks from within the Core would not be possible then, or at least by a small degree, as suggested by Whitespace blocks at Sanctuary elevator.

But the Core's sealed state does not mean the sleeping state of Sleeper, as it was already sleeping yet before Architect's betrayal, that is `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factorys). The Swarm feed of Whitespace, but once the Core was sealed, the Swarm was severed from it, which led it to breach it.

The Swarm was trapped within infinite Whitespace, while the external part managed to breach the Core and maintain itself, slowly expanding, as shown by movement of Unknown Passage in [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below).

##### The Pact

It is implied that gremlins had an assistance in building Clockworks. As in Whitespace it was seen to be possible to manifest matter, and, potentially, Divine Clockwork tunnels, based of its transition into the abstract. Would this mean that the concept of Swarm mirroring itself is Sleeper's term for not specifically multiplication, but creation? As it is the only instance of Swarm gaining power with the exactness of the method it gains it, we suggest it being the metaphor for creation.

`WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

This establishes a state preceding the current one. The term Creation will be looked at shortly.

The Swarm source within the Core was, while sealed, expanding with the direct access to the energy of the Core/Whitespace. In that interpretation, the Swarm on the outside would attempt entering itself, as it requires Energy to sustain itself. There is a possibility of that somebody intersecting into a relation of Swarm within the Whitespace and Sleeper, as it is told by Sleeper: `IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods), but it may also be a consequence of attempting to enter the Core by anybody except the Swarm as a potential threat to it's plan to escape the Core, as well as a potential foreshadowing of its raising activity in [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below), prior to activation of the second console.

With this theory we found at least one loose end: if the Whitespace is under control of the Swarm, while the Sanctuary hadn't already fallen? Yet we observe it's exterior - one behind the skydome, - as pure white. Could the be another consequence of Whitespace being infinite within the Core?

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

The Pact between the Sleeper and the Architect is struck. Betrayal of the Pact resulted in the current status quo of Core being Sealed, with `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` and `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

based on this we can gather, that the Pact had involved transformation of creation of Cradle into a mechanized fortress. Gremlins would inhabit and, at least, maintain its defenses.

We suggest it also being form Gremlins' perspective known as the Iron Law, due to its significance to Herex: `The Iron Law is Broken` (npc: [Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout)). This state of brokenness is characterized by supposed falsehood of Crimson Order: `The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world.` (npc: [Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout)).

By that, maintenance of the Pact, of ones upholding it - the Crimson Order, - is an incorrect position. The Truth and the Resonance could be referring to anything that comprises the Core - as it is called the heart of the World, - be it the Swarm, Whitespace, or the Sleeper.

The current condition of Cradle is one of broken Iron Law from Herex's perspective, and of broken Pact from the perspective of Sleeper, with the Core being currently sealed as a measure. And yet, the Core must be kept sealed for the Swarm not to escape.

We suggest a plausible explanation, which allows to resolve those conflicts - Iron Law is the idea of Core remaining sealed - a crisis-control measure to prevent Swarm from escaping, - as Crimson Oder supposedly did hide the Artifact prior to Skylark crash landing.

Through connections:

- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods

We suggest that the Sleeper was sleeping during the Pact breakage, as shields were drawn, and Cradle constructed. And as it was broken, the Swarm or rather the entity before it, if we consider it as `IT`, `opened the void`, and was consumed by it, as a result craving for Core's energy in a way, which had to be taken care of: `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel). And, through this affliction by the void and it's hunger it came to its the current physicality: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel).

It was transformed into the malevolent entity, as no danger prior to it, apart from abstract darkness, was present, - not within the `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory) At that, the Iron Law can be related to Sleeper's term of Iron Prison as Cradle and the Core, but mirroring its meaning.

Through this logic, we can propose, tha the entity suspected to help construct the Clockcorks is the initial, non-malevolent nature of Swarm, shared with the Whitepace by the fact of rectangular, similar, abstract design. Within this thought framework, it would mean that the Swarm found in the Shadow Lairs is the part of greater whole, sealed in the Core. The scenario of the Core had to be sealed seem to be the case of a temporary solution, which, while allowing to contain the Swarm, imprisoned with it Sleeper itself.

##### The Void

Before further analysis we will elaborate on the alchemical meaning of the Void, as one being of the same nature as First Matter. In that context it is known as the Round Chaos:

```md
The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always
and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and
everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley
writes: “The philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us
the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in
everything, in time and space.” “It offers itself in lowly form [vili
figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].”
According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material
principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the
divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere.
The chaos is a massa confusa that gives
birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden
elemental fire. In the treatise “De sulphure” hell-fire (ignis gehennalis)
is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to
Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all
the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos
confusum, so does the stone. The idea of the rotating aquasphere
reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle
or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation.
The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise
to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant:
here the σϕαīρος (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars,
owing to the influence of ϕιλία. The definition of this spherical being as
, “the most serene God,” sheds a special light on the
perfect, “round” nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes,
the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis.
The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace
of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. ...
It is the black,
magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also
called antimony and described as a “black blacker than black” (nigrum
nigrius nigro).

- "Psychology and Alchemy" - Carl Jung
```

Form this emerges a concept of god Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, or, the void. In this depiction, the void and round chaos preceding creation of gold, which is considered a divine metal. While, for now we won't relate or attempt to further connect it to the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), we will keep this concept and alchemical - symbolic meaning, - in mind.

Now we need a concrete nature of the Void, as it seems to be the catalyst for the transpiring events, relating to `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).

The Void is encountered physically once - as the identity of shadow enemies emerging from Swarm portals. The death of those entities signs at their distinct metaphysics, separate from the material realm.

The alchemical Void is the Prime Matter, from which, through alchemical transmutation, anything can be created by the alchemist. Here, most of material realm entities are copied of this void, or affected by it. Alchemical Void also has a chaotic aspect, which might be the malevolent intent - the hunger of the void - in this cosmology: `IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods). Yet, an action of opening the void had to precede it.

It is implied that the Swarm originated with Architect's maddening betrayal, and as discussed earlier, themes of hunger are present here, as in:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods]()
- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory]()
- The name of second depth of [It Came From Below]() - [`Into the Maw`]() - is a direct metaphor on the entrance to the Unknown Passage, as it is the first direct encounter with the Swarm across rank missions.
- Earlier organic themes of the Core, covered in the [Core Terminal section](#core-terminal)

it is suggested, that Cradle itself was twisted, or changed, to devour everything. Cradle is creation of Architect, who is the gremlin king (desc: `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks.` [Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze)).

  `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

Then, the madness, followed by betrayal, and finally, opening of the Void by non-malevolent Swarm are connected. What is the reason behind this maddening affliction?

And it seems that the Clockworks were completed by the time the king went mad, so something happened after the completion of the Clockworks and sealing of the Core and Architect going mad, - something which was not expected by the `mechanical genius`, which had to live through entirety of Clockworks construction, if he did exist. This would likely being the same time Tinkinzar had disappeared, as we have discussed on Pakrat speaking of the king as if he saw him: `... Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins.` (npc: [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)). With the consideration of the idea of a king being a only a concept, as [previously suggested](#king-tinkinzar), we can assume, that Crimson Order took reigns after king's maddening affliction.

This property of hunger of the void seemingly was inherited by the Swarm: `IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

This hunger, then, is metaphysical, as it transcends matter. Yet its capabilities are given through metaphors, as the rest of Sleeper's quotes:

- `THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE`

    Other than Almire, there are no kingdoms. The transformation of Lord Vanaduke, as if his heart was consumed. Souls of king's people is, likely, the state they are found - the Legion of Almire of undead, including cursed Carnavons. As all are classified as undead, and the fiery souls are released only by the time Lord Vanaduke himself is defeated and the Citadel start to crumble due to lack of `an eternal will` to keep it persisting.

    The other possibility is the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, which is connected to the Swarm by its presence in the Throne Room. If so, Darkfire Vanaduke would remain as a single king, whose heart was consumed. The rest of his people - their souls - would be consumed by the fact of curse afflicting them - as Carnavons. This also links to the Undeerworld, and now more explicitly, to curse, as we have linked those through the [nature of darkfire](#nature-of-darkfire) with the [Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire).

- `THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME`

  The knowledge of time could be interpreted as removal of any elements through which a chronology could be reconstructed, which is partially due to nature of Cradle. But, if we consider Almire being influenced by the underlying principle of the Swarm, then, this would mean that the Swarm is a concentrated embodiment of a different force, eventually connected to curse.

  The other aspect off this quote may be related to the parity of Shadow Lairs' and themes of Echo Stones:

  - [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods) speaks of Swarm as one to possess bestial features, which is similar to how Snarbolax is described: `Be advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes of which we have not seen before stalking this forest. Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry. Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible.` (desc: [Shadow of the Beast](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_of_the_Beast))
  - [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) speaks of Isorians as aliens falling onto Cradle, which is similar to how slimes arrived, from whom ice Queen is derived
  - [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) speaks of Cradle as gremlin creation after the gremlin facility
  - [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seemingly contains the same motif as one suggested in the context of Great Work in the [symbolic analysis](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-red-king-white-queen) of shadow lairs, as it brings conclusion to all of the above elements. In case of Echo Stones it had shown the extent of Swarm's influence through connection to kings - essentially Almire, - and then giving it a name. In case of Maiden's Tear, it a symbolic element to complete the spiritual Great Work manifested as capacity to traverse Shadow Lairs and eagerness to withstand them is the demonstration of the Swarm's power extent.

- `MEMORIES OF THE DEAD`

    Based of the earlier analysis of the metaphysical state Cradle is found, as one where spirits return to material realm, we concluded on 2 potential sources of this change: The Core and Kataclysm. We proposed that the Core had to be that phenomenon, as Kataclysm had to happen before Owlite Academy was incorporated into Cradle, and by nature of Void Souls within the core. As other instances of lost souls were connected to the Underworld and those metaphysics, we argued that the Core creates the condition for lost souls, yet consumed by the swarm, to emerge.
  
  It is also here a transcendental nature of the Void is seen, as it has the capacity to influence Lost Souls through the sequence of changes of the Swarm itself, leading to the idea of the Void being related to Souls.

- `GOOD AND EVIL`

    As if the hunger of the void extended beyond those concepts, we can suggest it being a metaphor not black and white morality, but total erasure of those concepts from the rest of the world, through their consumption, - the idea similar to nihilism.

    Another way to interpret this quote is rely on the Lovecraftian themes of eldritch entities - by that we mean that for them, concepts of good and evil do not exist. We see this argument as one fitting here, as th Swarm and the entire Herex plot line frames the Swarm and an eldritch entity, albeit an artificial one with a primordial component of the Void.

    This notion is similar to Apocrea, as it is also inspired by Lovecraftian Mythology. As Apocrea exists through souls, we can suggest, that it and th Void are also connected by the fact of capacity to directly interact with souls, as discussed in the [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines).

Considering all of this, opening of the Void still requires a will or an intent, as it was a direct action, one, we believe, to be related to Architect's madness and betrayal. We will return to him later.

Themes of hunger are present in other instances:

- `Though you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way. The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose.` (desc: [The Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester))
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires.` (desc: [Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation))

In both examples, we encounter some form of relation to shadows: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.` (npc: [The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness.` Shadows is also the term Alpha Squad refers to the Swarm: `We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice.` (npc: [Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)) as well as the the term of [Shadows Falling Over Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19).

Base on this we can compare the dual nature of the Void as Prime Matter, but also, Whitesapce to the Nameless Realm (desc: `... the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)).

Then it is the Void and Nameless Realm are seem to represent the opposites, as we initially proposed through a [vertical flow of souls as energy](#apocrean-engines).

The hunger is an essential element of it's duality represented by an organic aspect to an existing mechanical and eternal of Whitespace entities, which are vulnerable to darkness, such as Sleeper. The only darkness capable of existing in many different forms, yet united through the share of dealing shadow damage, is the darkness of Underword, which traces back to the case of [Divine and Whitesapce Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks).

The darkness can be traces into the Apocrean Realm, as those entities seem to represent a greater danger, yet less noticeable, on par with the Swarm, as both are capable of changing the environment within the Clockworks. And here, due to ambiguity and vagueness of Apocrea, we propose a different, more common, instance of metaphysical darkness - the curse. In seems as more plausible candidate, due to the evil eye symbolism. But, the void thematically does not seem to fit it, due to its pure blackness.

But, as the void remains one passed through the nature of Whitespace, which by itself, within the Core at least, led to Swarm taking qualities of Whitespace, seem to make it the exact unique entity in its inexplicable nature: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel), which seems to be part artificial, part Nameless Realm/Whitespace, part Void.

More connection can be drawn from the design of locked enemy gates - as mentioned in the [Divine and Whitespace Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks), the enemy gates are marked by deep purple eye, which seems us as point of connection of curse and whitespace, apart from being foreshadowed in the [promotional art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_30.png).

A 2-color quality is found here, as Swarm is characterized by the black and pink - purple in whitespace, while Whitespace is white, accompanied by yellow or gold.

Through this we can bring Swarm's nature to 3 essentials:

- [Divinity of Whitespace](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks)
- Chaos and hunger of the Void, with this capacity to manipulate souls, relation to Nameless Realm though duality, [symbolically linked to Prima Materia and Chaos](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-red-king-white-queen)
- A [color-coded symbolic association to curse](#analysis-of-curse)

This will be our foundation to work from.

<!-- Apocrea specifically represents some interesting motifs:

- [Apocrean harvester](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester) has symbolism of 3 eyes
scarabs have 3 eyes and are associated with the Undead
- Apocrea thematically is associated with Lovecraftian mythos, but the connection, with Scarabs introduced, is deeper:
- Both scarabs and Apocrean harvester resemble insects in their anatomy, or at least, Arthropods
- Presence of 3 eyes must be reinstated, as the only instance of such symbolism we observe at the respawn pads in the Whitespace
- Back in [Arrival of Undercorp](#arrival-of-undercorp) Snarbolax was pointed out as one with the cursed mane and prior of 3 eyes - I suspect this was intentional design choice to demonstrate the capacity of the curse in it's many forms. -->

##### The Resonance

<!-- Now back to Herex, he considers Iron Law to be broken, we'll think of it as the Pact, Crimson Order, which was established at some point in time, being false. -->

<!-- Herex secretly activates the Artifact, which was recovered recently, seemingly hidden, so this implies that the Crimson Order was responsible for it's placement. Strangers are unaware of this, while they do know of gremlin history but not of the Core. Herex in that sense sees the reason of King's madness as the Truth, so, can we consider Herex as mad the same way Sleeper considered Architect as mad? -->

- `The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth.` (npc: [Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Recon Module - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout))
- `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other.` (npc: [Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357))

Comprehenson of truth is tied to being located in the Core. The truth is equal to the metaphor of hearing the resonance beating, then, in the Core. Based of the idea of Crimson Order sealing the Core as an aftereffect of Architect's madness and betrayal,the analogue to being blind and deaf seem to fit, as being cut off the truth within the Core. Herex's Truth in that context means following Architect's madness. Which, through the alignment with the Swarm, seem to suggest it being a truth from the perspective of madness.

So, does this mean that the Swarm is referred the Truth? We have clues, thematic at that. The only concrete distinction of the Swarm is that it opposes Sleeper and it was brought to existence through a combination of 3 essentials.

Here we will discuss the plausibility of those essentials to serve as the catalyst for Swarm's conception trough the logic of energy and souls.

Chaos cloak grants protection in the Nameless Realm, and is characterized by elemental defense. It also has depiction of an antique evil eye, linking to curse though this design, as well as weakness to curse and all statuses. Th divine veil, by nature of divine protect of all unnatural damage - shadow and elemental. Through the analysis of elementals, which [power Clockwork facilities](#clockworks-and-magitek), they also can be considered as unnatural. Compared to the affinity within Nameless Realm, divinity grants protection from curse. We have followed this logic during [intermediate analysis of curse]() - with this we gathered, that nameless realm incorporates curse as a natural phenomenon.

Divine avenger inverts the curse, transforming it to elemental damage, yet with prevalent Dread Seal symbolism. This was covered in the [Inversion of Curse](). This motif, encapsulated by the Avenger may be the exact lead we are searching for, due to to symbolism of gold in relation to divinity and as complementary color in Whitespace. A similar extrapolation was in the phenomenon of [glowing patterns on the Ancient Grove ruins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-March_of_the_Tortodrones-Ancient_Grove.png), outer carvings of [Tortofists](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist), and inner surface of [tortoise shields](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise), glow pattern of [Gran Faut](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) and [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield). All of those items relate to Underworld.

Due to this we can suggest, that Whitesapce is the divine, and stems from the nature of Nameless Relam as foundation of all existence. The chaos of the Nameless Realm is the Void, an aspect stemming from its duality. Due to Void and Nameless Realm being interpretations of Prime Matter, their duality, as of Prime Matter, seems fitting. The Nameless Realm incorporates the curse as curse emerges from it, same as the Underworld by virtue of being at least partially material. Opening the void then means introducing a primordial chaos to the ordered divine from the perspective of Sleeper, weather the void was opened in the Whitespace, which can be framed as the metaphor for chaos and order.

It is then the nature of Swarm which encompasses all of it. As curse was encountered in large amount of shapes, forms, and manifestations, under a specific application it is plausible to manifest unseen earlier phenomenon. We propose that:

__The Swarm is a union of an entity of Whitespace, driven by a transformative nature of curse, and amplified by the direct contact with the Void.__

Through the primordial nature of the Void, the organic motif is incorporated into the divine themes of Whitespace, and manifested as the evil eye with an organic aspect - seen as the Swarm entity found in Dreams and Nightmares, The Path is Revealed.

Yet, this is a speculation without an argument. For this we are required to look at the greater narratives across the established timeline, as well as the idea of Architect's madness.

##### The Madness

Returning to Architect's madness. We will follow with the proposal of king Tinkinzar being the Architect, one to live through existence of Cradle from its conception.

It is here we should finally look at the name of Clockworks. The name suggests, that it is a clock, and a countdown. Based of: `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS. THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON. IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), we can suggest, that this term is referring to Sleeper's awakening. So, what should follow the awakening? As far as natural order goes, and its position in Whitesapce, essentially Nameless Realm, we can suggest a paradigm shift, which we belie, is the reason behind spirits returning to material realm.

Then, there is a Pact, which, considering nature of Sleeper from the perspective of material realm, a supernatural, a Pact with a deity. while attempting to cross-reference the general structure of this narrative, we found a myth involving the concept of a philosopher-king and deities, which might serve as a basis for the story to be subverted within the story of the Architect.

The following concept is one of more general trope of a king's rule being taken over by a council of multiple figures, due to king's breakdown under an ambiguous, varying across myths and stories, reasons. But one particular example, which by itself serves as the foundation for such narrative, is the aforementioned concept of a philosopher-king, - king Solomon.

- The Architect, supposed to be king Tinkinzar, makes a Pact with an entity known as Sleeper.

    Details of the Pact are vague, but, from our understanding, it has 2 essential elements: Sleeper had to be protected from the darkness in what ill eventually become Cradle and gremlins are to be placed in charge of Cradle's defenses (npc: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans.` - [Dream and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

    This seems as a beneficial act, as Sleeper would provide resources for initial construction of Clockworks, while gremlins do the work, in the process creating Great Colony. The Sleeper's resource we are referring to is the assistance to gremlins in construction of Clockworks in the form of matter-materializing entity, which would become the Swarm, as evident by the ability of Whitespace to manufacture solid matter out of nothing in the events of Unknown Passage, and potential creation of Divine/Whitespace Clockwork tunnels in [A Step Beyond]().
- As all clans serve the Great Colony, and by proxy king Tinkinzar, we can suggest, that gremlin clan structure or at least the stained relation between them was not so prominent, as the rule was initially more stable, yet absolute, than it is found during the present game's events.

    As gremlin clans located in their according stratums, forming the general territory of what could've been considered gremlin empire on across Clockworks, we can draw, that, with the delegation of factories to clans, such as Ironclaw Munitions Factory, the general stability of the civilization would not be of a concern, until a dispute arises.

    Such event, we propose, is the madness and disappearance of the king, and, with no king, reign had to be taken over by Crimson Order. Within this, more mythological interpretation, the statements as `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` from the screens at Engines of War, would seem as maintenance of the status quo by the Iron Law.
- The madness in question, then, if we are looking for its reason as external, should thematically be related to such entities as Nefarious Imp or Apocrea.

    Considering prior civilizations, - Owlites and Tortomega, - they seem to fall due to scheming of  Underworld. In the context of Sleeper, as it is one entity required to be protected from the darkness, we believe, is a hint at the nature of the madness. As it is stated: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.` (npc: [The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness.`

    This seems as a hint to the induced nature of madness.

Essentially, we are linking Tinkinzar's madness, themes of alchemical Great Work, a repeated pattern of civilizations crumbling to Underworld's presence and schemes, introduction of cosmic horror motifs, - to Swarm's creation, as one related to Underworld though the incorporation of curse into the narrative:

- Presence of cosmic horror by its themes suspends the concept of "Truth" in the themes of cosmic incomprehensibility.

    This theme introduces a justified motif of madness within the abstracted cosmic horror story. Based on the eldritch component of the narrative, it is revealing nature of truth as maddening by being a case of [going mad from the revelation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation). It is embodied by Herex and a later rank missions transition to this theme most recognized by seeming inexplicability of the Swarm.

- The concept of king Tinkinzar, as we have proposed, to be linked to the trope of the trope of the philosopher-king, stemming from the king Solomon. Due to this we proposed an existence of a parallel between Tinkinzar's vision of Clockworks and Solomon's divine inspiration and vision of the First Temple.

    Then it is the quote, - `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT` (npc: [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), - which we suggest being here a deconstruction of Solomon's eventual end as God left him, with the full punishment following later, as the kingdom would be divided after Solomon's death. So is the idea of the Great Colony being then ruled over by the Crimson order, which followed after Tinkinzar's madness. The madness here, we suggest, holds the aspect of above motif of cosmic horror story.
- Then, the last component - due to which, mainly, the entire timeline was reconstructed, - the pattern of Underworld's intervention first as a newfound source of power desired within the context of an isolated narrative.

    It is represented by Titans falling to Undercorp, Owlites erased by Kataclysm, Almire falling due to Lord Vanaduke's actions, and several smaller narratives such as trojans, kat tribe, and Snarbolax, - all related to different iterations and manifestations of curse as both literal and metaphorical carrier of Underworld's presence. Then, by addition to each iteration of a greater scope of the narrative than previous - as Titans were set in the woods, as Almire was a kingdom eventually becoming and undead Empire, and as Owlites were set in the setting of the entirety of heavenly kingdom, gremlins are paired with an entire planet, while encompassing all of the prior, - this seems as a distinct narrative if framed in such manner.

    Here a deconstruction of the concept of Underworld is presented through the identified actor, - a corporate entity - Undercorp, and by a more mysterious actor - Nefarious Imp, who we suspected to be related to Underworld's lingering presence on Cradle. Here, we believe, gremlins are fulfilling this role of the repeating patter, as they are known to work with Undercorp.

Whith end of civilizations facing with the Underworld and falling, brought into the Clockworks as past histories, with high stakes, it would be fitting for the nature of this narrative's danger be the same, yet drawn to the extremes as far as the established metaphysics of the fictional Unverse would allow, without breaking the suspension of disbelief by an unpredictable force, which was written into the canon in the last moment.

With all of those components, we suggest the justification behind introduction of curse to the story of Swarm's creation, as an ultimate failure to uphold the Pact struck with the Sleeper due to Underworld's influence. The madness aspect then is reinstated by the possible cosmic horror nature of truth/madness as one related to an already eldritch entity apart from alchemical Nameless Realm, that being Apocrea, and potentially channeled or represented through actions of a single entity, such as Nefarious Imp.

As for the alchemical motifs, we seem them here as also subverted. Within this thought framework, it would be fitting to be the truth behind immortality as reason for induced madness - as the final goal of alchemy, - achieved either through curse, as seen prior, or alignment with the supposedly divine powers of the Sleeper, which would've been an explanation for Tinkinzar's longevity up until his madness, while following the idea of greater darkness endangering Sleeper.

In that sense, referring to the alchemical lore, - Herex's goal is one of intentionally replicating a state of immortality, accidentally achieved before by past civilizations. The process is flawed and requires incorporation of curse, essentially a damnation, causing extermination of kingdoms and species as a consequence. Yet, it manages to follow general alchemical lore of immortality being the Magnum Opus, Great Work, the Philosopher's Stone and Elixir of Immortality, which, given interconnectedness of mechanical with magical in [Clockworks and Magitek](#clockworks-and-magitek), seems particularly conclusive.

Arrival of Isorians being framed as fated seems to be a continuation of a concluded narrative within the nature of the game as one without a distinct end, but also as a final attempt to alchemically and symbolically redeem the past events in even greater stakes, as suggested by Sleeper: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS. YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` (npc: [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).

#### Rebis Theory

Rebis theory proposes the existence of an alchemical framework, which constitutes a narrative at the foundation of interaction across the material realm, Nameless Realm, the Void, metaphysics of curse and Underworld, as parts of a unified cosmology through metaphors and interpretations of alchemical lore.

Rebis theory proposes an existence of alchemical narrative within the story of Clockworks and Cradle. This alchemical narrative, a hermetic truth, serves as the foundation for the motifs of characters which operate within this set of physical laws, exploring potential ends of the Great Work in its many instances across history of Cradle, Clockworks, and civilizations which were incorporated into prior.

### Chapter `X`: Spiral Knights

>_"Should You Choose to Accept"_

In this chapter we will cover entirety of the timeline from the very beginning.

1. In the beginning exists the Void, from which all matter originates in the form of material realm, Nameless Relam, Underworld with the Vlinding Abyss, and Apocrean Realm.

    Those realms are stacked on top of each other.

    Nameless Realm is at top, followed by material realm, Underworld, Blinding Abyss, Apocrean Relam, and ending in the primordial Void. Within this cosmology all matter is a form of energy, including the souls. Souls specifically emerge from the Nameless Realm, and manifest in the material realm as consciousnesses and their auras as physical bodies.
2. From souls and sentience civilizations emerge, the first one being dragons. They were capable of traversing al realms without restrictions.

    In physiology, there were of divinity - elemental dragons, of frenzy - shadow dragons, and of rage - red dragons.
3. Then came valkyries, later be known as Owlites, but now they are known as the celestial beings in the heavenly kingdom, located in the Nameless Realm.
4. Valkyries slayed dragons, allowing for material realm to be created, and by that they left the Nameless Realm. That is the creation myth.

    In the heavenly kingdom they were protectors of a realm and a deity residing within, later known as the Sleeper, from Underworld, manifested as darkness or curse.

5. Underworld develops by itself in isolation from the material realm.

    Underworld and Apocrean Realm exist as separated realms. The main distinction is in the fact Apocrean Realm was aware of the general cosmology by nature of being eldritch entities, and was located in proximity of Underword.
6. Then came Isorians, they also developed on their own, yet from early history had encounters with dragons.
7. Undeworld is shortly discovered by Isorians, which shaped their own culture and myths, of deities in the mountains.
8. After some time, Isorains started hunting dragons. With this power they eventually developed into an interstellar empire.
9. By that time dragons had descendants - drakes, wyverns and tortoises. Among them, only tortoises had developed into a civilization, known as tortomega upon the planet, which wold eventually become Cradle. Their homeland would be the now shattered Aurora Isles, with the rest of their territory located in the Gloaming Wildwoods.
10. Tortomega and Valkyries are warring civilization in the material realm. During this period tortomega would become known as Titans. The relation between both is complex. Primarily, titans built floating castles for valkyries. Those castles composed the heavenly kingdom within the material realm.

    And yet, titans were pressed by valkyries back into the woods. where they discovered the Underworld.
11. Underworld had a connection with the Apocrean Relam. By that point Underworld contained full-fledged corporations, such as Undercorp.
12. As Titans uncovered Underworld, under a lead of Nefarious Imp, both civilization in beneficial agreement managed to back up and developed or likely introduced to material realm shadow graviton technology. By nature of the latter, it utilizes glyphs and souls to operate, which are at their core, energy.

    Through further development of graviton technology, Grim Gates are built, though which devilite cities are transported into material realm. It is during this period of time tortodrones are build, powered by crimsonite.
13. At some point, Undercorp betrays Titans and subdues them by the machinery of tortodrones, originally developed to assist Titans.

    As Titans are at war with Undercorp, they break all connection with the Underworld through destruction of Grim Gates. This causes to curse to pour in in uncontrolled manner into the woods, afflicting wildlife of the Gloaming Wildwoods. Due to this, Snarbolax as an immortal bearer of curse, is born.

    The Ancient Grove within the Wildwoods becomes Undercorp's staging area for the corrupted tortodrones.
14. Remaining Titans flee in the remaining territories within the Aurora Isles and fall into deep sleep, in order to hide and outlive the erasure of their civilization. The remaining tortodrones are left without their masters.

    This place where Titans had fallen to slumber will be known as Starlight Cradle.
15. Isorians are now a spacefaring civilization with an established Spiral Order. Those spacefaring vessels came before any major colonies were established. One of such vessels falls on planet later to become Cradle, wherein all technological advancements have no use.
16. On, essentially, Cradle, those stranded Isorians develop a medieval civilization, which would eventually become the kingdom of Almire, kingdom of Ironmight, and of northerns settlements of raiders.
17. Near that time Underworld is found by Isorians for the second time and Valkyries are generally hold neutral. This epoch will be known as the forgotten time.

    During this period of time some most ancient weapons would be created, which, by virtue, carried into the modern times, such as inherited from Titans heavy swords with an amount of inner elemental energy, gunpowder-powered handguns, and blades forged to slay the undead. Gunslinger priests they were called.

    These designs would eventually be adopted by Valkyries, as it turns out, piercing weapons are effective against the Underworld fiends, and Isorians had only those in their disposal, due to lack of knowledge on underworld or of greater elemental powers.
18. And yet, isorians presented a danger to Valkyrian rule, as they had their experience with the Underword. 

    One of Valkyrians driven by ambition of power of Underworld, orchestrates a creation of a stone army, made of spiral wardens. Those became Trojans of Legion of Ur. For this, Fallen Valkyrian is banished from the heavenly kingdom. With this plot uncovered, Fallen Valkyrian and trojans, now known as Legion of Ur, conquer the Underworld.
19. Due to this, heavenly kingdom now oversees the mountains, within which an entrance to the Underworld is hidden.
20. In contrast to nature of those mountains, a kingdom of Almire flourishes, as it is under the divine protection of Spirit Mother.

    Near this kingdom, kingdom of Ironmight exists, which has in their disposal magical trees. From their wood one of most durable armors were created. And it was the kingdom to hold the economic power over the region.

    Almire in that regard had their own developments. While being a kingdom generally attuned to nature, it found fiery elemental in the mountains.
21. Through the proximity to Underworld's influence, fiendish cults had there development there, leading to crating of altars to those Underworld deities.
22. As heavenly kingdom remain in the sky, a war between Ironmight kingdom and kingdom of Almire breaks out. Northern raider assisted Ironmight kingdom.
23. The war led to Almire's Fall and Lord Vanadukes leaving into mountains in search for myths, inherited from a war between Titans and Valkyries, including aftermath of Titan's erasure by Undercorp, and stories of legion of Ur.
24. As war went, apart from a cult of a volcanic deity, later known to be, likely, Vog, across graveyards a different cult emerges - of a nameless Vile deity, related to poisons and rot.
25. As Almire's army was overpower, Lord Vanaduke flees into the volcanic mountains. There, he finds fiery cult's chamber.

    It curses Lord Vanaduke, causing him to emerge from the mountains with an Underworld army of trojans.
26. Lord Vanaduke returns, frees Almire of the invaders and conquers their lands. With this an undead Almirian Empire is founded.
27. Valkyries invade Underworld in order to purge it of Legion of Ur, as they saw extent of their might. With this, they seal the Legion of ur in the Underworld.
28. A tribe of Kats develops, they invade heavenly kingdom, specifically Owlite Academy, and through ill-usage of tomes located there, cause Kataclysm, erasing both civilizations.

    Kataclysm takes part of Owlite Academy at the epicenter of the cataclysm into the realm close to the Underworld.
29. This state of affairs lasts for a long time, until the planet was found by gremlin interstellar empire.

    Here the first contact with the Sleeper was established by king Tinkinzar. Sleeper reveals itself as a ancient entity, unprotected by heavenly kingdom, yet capable of beneficial actions.
30. Sleeper shows Tinkinzar a grand vision of what will eventually become Cradle, devised to be a new home for gremlins, as they protect it.
31. In this vision Clockworks are built, utilizing both knowledge of elementals as well as more natural sciences.

    The Core, which would contain and protect Sleeper, introduced Nameless Realm into the material realm in the form of contained Whitepace. Several control points are built to secure access to the Core, the Sanctuary.
32. The king reunites all warring gremlin clans, giving the most prosperous time for the empire, located in the Great Colony.
33. Eventually the king succumbs to madness, which accompanied him in later years, breaking the agreement.

    Tinkinzar's madness is considered to be brought by Undercorp's intervention, specifically, Nefarious Imp. In the result, curse was be applied at the nature of Nameless Realm, now present in material realm as the Whitespace.

    This transformation and introduction of curse results in the foundation of Clockworks' building resource to be influenced by curse, yet, due to it's nature of Nameless Relam, it was in greater proximity to the fundamental alchemical forces of the universe, tapping directly into the Void. Amplified and merged with the chaotic nature of the Void, the Swarm was created - an inverse of what it initially was.
34. As king was succumbing to madness, an Order of 9 members, Crimson Order, was founded to uphold king's reign. Under the reign of Crimson Order Iron Law is established as a measure of containing the failing empire as well as the Swarm at a cost of sealing the Core, which imprisoned the Sleeper within its confinements.

    Sealing of the Core creates a metaphysical shift, as departed spirit now return to material realm, but severing Underworld, and making graveyards from Almirian age far more dangerous. As fallen civilization came back to life, apart from eternally shrouded by curse Almire and Owlites, forcing them to be contained within Clockworks. As such, graveyards of the Almirian Empire are now brought down in proximity of Underworld by the amount of souls after Almirian-Ironmights war contained there and unable to depart.
35. The Core is sealed, Core Terminal's passage is destroyed, and the device, the Artifact, used to activate thee consoles, is hidden.
36. Across Isorian colonies a war erupts, leading to a prolonged conflict, known as the Morai Wars. This war leaves most of the civilization in ruins and without a sun. This causes all parties to search an unprecedented energy source.
37. Morai vessel in their search for energy, stumbles onto Cradle and is shot down by its defenses. Morai soldier are raised from the dead under Core's influence. As the Citadel, and as undead, they are contained by gremlins.
38. Lichen meteorite fall on Cradle, gremlins use slime's properties to bioengineer purposed organisms in the maintenance of Clockworks.
39. Near a hundred years later, another, now Isorian vessel - Skylark, - would discover Cradle. Cradle's defenses strike Skylark down, causing it to crash land on Cradle's surface. This, finally, leads to the events of the game.
40. Crimson Order member Herex is influenced by the same madness as one afflicted Tinkinzar, causing him to seek hidden Artifact.

    It was retrieved, applied to the console in Owlite ruins now ruled by the Jelly King. After activation the Core had opened for a moment, exactly by the time Alpha Squad reached the Core Terminal in persuit of the Swarm, which felt the Core opening.

    After that the Artifact was brought into the derelict facility below Rescue Camp near Haven Arcade, and Razwog was tasked to recharge the Artifact.

#### `DEPTH 0`: Crash Site

Skylark discovers Cradle, and is hit by gremlin shadow artillery. This decision was made in order to prevent any possibility of the Swarm escaping under the directive of Iron Law.

Skylask crash lands, main generator broken with the secondary generator moved to Strangers' Haven Lab, which remained at planet surface. Strangers persisted through Almire conflict, Katastropthe and emergence of Clockworks.

Skylark secondary generator has design similar to Arcade's Gate Pillars, as well as generator left base, I'll skip the asset flip theory, focusing strictly on lore implication this similarity.

Alpha Squad begins a descend. Based on energy spike discovered at the Royal Jelly Palace and then at the Firestorm Citadel, with the Core opening at least twice, with the secind being the event of Dreams and nightmares, it is likely that the time Artifact was used in the RJP, was by the time Alpha Squad managed to descend to the Core Terminal, and, as in DaN, is hunted by the Swarm, attracted to the openning hatch from te Shadow Lairs

#### `DEPTH 2`: Battle Sprites

Spiral battle sprites are transformed into images of the past civilisation by the Core through same power of mirroring of the Swarm as it replicated/mirrored ancient places, transforming, but remain as constructs/potentially beiomechanical entities (desc: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment ...` [A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab)).

The fact that battle sprites were transfromed by the Energy of the Core while preserving their fundamental properties is proven by several points:

- `... The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite ...  Something has happened to them, they've changed into some kind of creature ...` (desc: [A Revelation in Flames / Sunset Steppes - Rhendon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes))

##### Evo Catalysts

For all sprites, to fully manifest their powers, [catalysts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ultimate_Evo_Catalyst#Evo_Catalyst) are used, as they contain far greater amount of Energy, while being contained within same mechanism in design and principle of a flat, plated structure, as the Core. The source of Catalysts is, considering its' designs is created by gremlins fo their own use.

We don't know usage of catalysts, as well as it's range of applications, but considering it's effects, it cabn be seen that an initial amount of energy was applied to the sprites in order to transform them.

#### `DEPTH 3`: The Collector

Crimson Order, at some point, constructed the Collector. As the Collector has shadow damage areal attack, similar to Dark retribution, it can be suggested that it was devised by the Order, or even Seerus, as he is Crimson Order's warmaster.

Apart from construct dealing shadow damage, this explosion has graviton bomb antique evil eye image, also painted on the mechanical eye of the collector. Collcator's backpack has inverted ghostlink block symbol of an ryr, still pointing to a source of lights, same as with the ghostlink blocks

#### `DEPTH 8`: Resurrection of Margrel, behind the Grim Gates


#### `DEPTH ???`: Shadow Lairs

Unlike all, curse from Underworlf and whitespace of Nameless Realm

The Core is the means of nameless realm entities exiting within the material realm, but it sets a precedent for undeworld, as it did many times, influence it over a common ground of the material realm.




Material Relam is of regular matter, Nameless Realm specifically is the extension of the Void, and it is inhabited by divine entities

Through continuos research of Cradle and it's past, gremlin king Tinkinzar of the Great Colony establishes a connection with the Nameless Realm, wherein Sleeper slept, through this connection a Pact was established:

The Sanctuary is the place of Sleeper, it is also the Refuge, all located within the Whitespace and Clockwork skydome.

Based on the analysis of skydomes, as they seemingly capable of constant suspension of the landmass within, this principle links back to the the Core as one object around which everything is built.

The Sanctuary Alchemy Machine, as the Mysterious Alchemy Station, have recipes Spiral Order could not have known, paralleling items - materials, equipment, furniture and costumes, - acquired for tokens. In the prior 2 cases, the ability of alchemy to transcend time and causality seems as most plausible explanation.

The symbol of alchemy in that regard, seem to belong to the nature of Whitespace, as no known machinery exists to manufacture Whitespace by gremlins, so, it is Sleeper's doing, which ties with the idea of the symbol of alchemy as one coming from the other realm. Here we also connect Spirit Mother's realm to Whitespace, as both contain sentience and relate to divinity. The distinction here is the nature of Whitespace as artificial transitory construction, which still allows for laws of material realm to exist - in a form of Clockwork technology. It is essentially a point off transition to the other realm in the same manner as graveyards and Owlite Academy are in the transitory state to the Underworld.

The Void then is the chaos and nothingness of Prime Matter. It can be shaped into anything, but requires the prolonged process of transformation. So is the Nameless Realm, which should have been the alchemical Void.

<!-- its cpacity t replicate and to mirror is manifested as the regular firestorm citadel, while the Shdow citadel is the true one, with th efull pwer of the curse lingering? -->

<!-- a technology to build, or rather, mirror the rest of the Clockworks, powered by the Nameless Reaml, it's energy, emerged - the swarm. Originally, invention of gremlins, with the energy from the Nameless Realm, it is transformed into an semi-organic entity (in similar manner as spiral battle sprites will be transformed into biomechanical entities). Now It is an entity of very same energy of Nameless Realm, both a technology and a constant - a shape of the sentient energy same as the Sleeper, once it is brought into the material realm.

A Core is built and the rest of the clockworks were built by the swarm of machines, capable of replicating matter from energy. For the Namelss Realm separated fto the material realm gremlins had there own name - the Whitespace. Within the strange matter of whitespace, Sleeper now rests protected in the Core, separate from the unity and divinity of Nameless Realm proper, referred to as the Void, not malevolent one currently, but a form of most primordial of matter.

As Clockworks were built, some of the most dangerous entities of the Cradle were made hidden within the deepest parts of Clockworks, such as fallen Almirian capital - the Necropolis, Great Citadel, know only known as the Firestorm Citadel, and once floating through Cradle's sky Owlite Scarlet Fortess, traveling through Clockworks as a mass of castles.

https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator

https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm

If Clockworks were being constructed during that time, they must have to originate from the Core, in order to be built, which ties in with the relation of an Architect and the Sleeper within the Shadow Lairs' Sanctuary, it also will be revisited later, but currently these possible implications must be kept in mind. This also leads to a possibility of gremlins originally being rather underground specie, as the Core either have been built in-place of Cradle's natural core, or was lowered theres.

The process of Core construction implies at least presence of the Core hatch, access consoles and the Artifact, with the consoles being present in a few locations on Cradle, including the Firestorm Citadel and Royal Jelly Palace. Now, considering that [the Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet) is guarded by gremlins in the [Reign of Fire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet) as well as the [Last Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand) has elements of Scarlet Fortress and Clockworks' monitors, it is plausible for gremlins to fortify this passage to the Citadel intentionally, for reasons explored in the next section.

Backing to the Core, the Whitespace within has same element of clockwork tunnels being replaced by Whitespace tiles, as well as an entire skydome structure present within the Core ([Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge), [Sanctuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary), if believed to be located within the Core), that must also be kept in mind for the overarching themes. -->

#### `DEPTH 29`: The Path Is Revealed

The hatch and console logic recap

#### `DEPTH 30`: THE CORE

Core and whitepsace

nameless realm of dreaming entities - which create, origin of souls as raw energy, and it's opposite - apocrean realm whose inhabitants make nightmares, still create and are powered by souls, there souls die. The abyss just is?

The Void is weaponized by the presence of curse originating from the Underworld. This prime matter itself has no will no intent and flows from Nameless Relam into the material, both as the source of all matter but also as souls for living beings. Those 2 forms of primal matter are all at their core energy. This energy, mainly in form of souls, after death in material realm, reaches Underworld, and from there - into the Blinding Abyss. Apocrea here is the middleman who lives on that same energy, yet it can't reach Nameless Relam. Then it acts through underworld, whose death-based nature manifests as curse, which though actions of gremlins, had affected pure energy of Nameless Realm. This caused gremlins to seal Swarm with the portion of Nameless Relam within the Core, wherein core served as an extractor of energy from nameless realm.

##### Sanctuary

##### Orbs of Alchemy

Here we would return for the alchemy orbs and alchemy stations. With the knowledge of both energy in the setting, and of the vague nature of real-world alchemy, it being manifestations of energy in the same manner as fire crystals and minerals, but of higher order composition, for example, souls, as in charged minerals. We know that as they preserve the memory of the time they existed, yet they had to be indistinguishable, in order to perform stable alchemy. This lead to an idea, which would allow for the process of transmutation to work as intended, while remaining in the confinements of alchemy, - that is the hegelian World Spirit, an omnipresent unconscious memory of the world within a certain culture.

We arrive to this conclusion mainly due to optionality of recipes for Sanctuary and Mysterious alchemy station, as this would mean that the knight already, paradoxically, is aware of, for example, Amirian or Kat tribe designs. The only way those could exist, as if the knowledge of those was given. And, within the metaphysics of the Core, which tethers everything, such understanding would be plausible, as it is accumulated in a more reaving presence of an entity, knowing of what was happening throughout history.

The container of 2 golden plates, we suggest, is the same phenomenon as used on Cradle, to contain the divinity - of a part of Nameless Realm, - in the most pure metal. If we to follow alchemical symbolism of gold, it is the divine metal which is linked to the divinity, here symbolized by the cosmology of Nameless Realm.

```md
The work is crowned by the production of the rotundum, which, as the
materia globosa, stands at the beginning and also at the end, in the form
of gold.
```

This makes it seem as if Orb of Alchemy already was the completed Work, and yet it is a tool in the general narrative.

In regards to the Fire Crystall, they have similar inner glow as orbs of alchemy. Apart from those similarities, heat is present as an floating essence, or as fire crystals. As with the energy and souls, we suggest, heat is the same in nature, that is it can be collected to crystals, under the same principle as minerals contain energy.

### Afterword

And, at that very point, this conclusion could be the farthest thing from the truth, one being that all of this conncetions were not intended - that is they were not devised with a fixed cosmology and consistency in mind. This scenrio then, suggests everything is up to players interpratation through speculation and personal experience of similar media.

This analysis, as a project, began from a question - why the concept of Swarm, it's nature as an unclassified entity, in a larger scope from a sence that it is a storytelling element, a trope, or a narreme, was so captivating for more than a decade after the game had initially launched. Why amongs all of content and context present in the game, metaphysics of the last remaining and most mysterious entity, represented as Shadow Lairs, was the element which propelled this analysis.

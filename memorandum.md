**Hail Knights! This was a long time coming.**

After nearly a year in the making, our researchers compiled the **most complete to date timeline**, â€” wherein history of Cradle, every depth, every gear, every material and recipe, and _everything_ in between was dissected, analyzed, put together, and **solved**, so that no unanswered questions would remain. This proposal is finally available under the codename of...

[**REBIS THEORY ðŸœ”**](https://ironkayman.github.io/entries/rebis-theory)

Here, we are to identify _nature of curse_, _the Swarm_, entire cosmology behind _Nameless Realm_, _Spirit Mother_ and why spirit return to material realm, _Underworld_, _Heavenly Kingdom_, _Apocrea_, _Architect's Madness_ and Clockworks, their respective alchemical themes, eldritch motifs, and **much more**!

Most importantly, **we present a cohesive, complete system**, to which entirety of this cosmology abides!

_P.S. We have considered the sheer scale of the document, so be rest assured, â€” our biotechs are ~~outsourcing to Undercorp~~ already working on the video presentation._
